Unlike more traditional OCR approaches, Kraken relies on a neural network—which mimics the way we learn—to recognize letters in the images of entire lines of text without trying first to segment lines into words and then words into letters. This segmentation step—a mainstream OCR approach that persistently fails on connected scripts—is thus completely removed from the process, making Kraken uniquely powerful for dealing with a diverse variety of ligatures in connected Arabic script.

Most of us took great pleasure in advanced reading classes with our professors, but, often struggling with an overwhelming volume of new vocabulary, we also—at least occasionally—had a feeling that a traditional method is not necessarily the most effective one. While advanced students usually overcome this difficulty by their sheer passion for the subject, the introduction of excessive vocabulary creates a serious obstacle to less advanced yet capable students.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/fbr/reader_cover.png&quot; alt=&quot;image-right&quot; class=&quot;align-right-border&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pervasive availability of electronic texts and computational methods of text analysis allows us to rethink how we teach difficult languages. We can identify the most frequent features within a corpus and focus our attention on them. For example, the 100 most frequent lexical items constitute about 56% of the entire vocabulary of over 34,000 Prophetic sayings (&lt;em&gt;ḥadīṯ&lt;/em&gt;) from the Six [Sunnī] Collections (&lt;em&gt;al-kutub al-sittaŧ&lt;/em&gt;, approximately 2.8 million words). Relying on such data, one can generate a frequency-based reader that will introduce students to the shortest texts with the most frequent vocabulary and grammatical structures. With a paced increase in difficulty of texts and incremental expansion of vocabulary, students are capable of digesting much larger volumes of text both in class and at home, and such an extended exposure enables students to internalize the authentic language more efficiently. For example, in the course of one semester, we managed to cover about 400 &lt;em&gt;ḥadīṯ&lt;/em&gt;s, while at the same time reviewing the grammar of classical Arabic and having regular discussions of thematic readings that helped students to understand the cultural importance of the Ḥadīṯ across almost 14 centuries of Islamic history.&lt;a href=&quot;#fn1&quot; class=&quot;footnoteRef&quot; id=&quot;fnref1&quot;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While developed primarily with classical Arabic in mind, the approach is actually universal and can be used for any language. It works best with serialized texts—that is a large corpus of relatively short text of the same type (in the case of Arabic that would be &lt;em&gt;ḥadīṯ&lt;/em&gt; collections, chronicles, biographical collections, poetic anthologies, contemporary newspapers, etc.). Considering that in terms of vocabulary various forms and genres may differ from each other quite significantly (Figure &lt;a href=&quot;#fig:3000&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt; shows that such difference may go up to 80%!), this method can be used to introduce students to the language of particular genres in the most efficient manner. Courses based on such readers can be a valuable addition to any language program and will be particularly welcomed by graduate students who often face the need to develop their readings skills as quickly and efficiently as possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;fig:3000&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;fit&quot;&gt;
	&lt;a href=&quot;../images/fbr/3000a.png&quot;&gt;

	&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;b&gt;Figure 1.&lt;/b&gt; The matrix shows lexical overlap across the frequency lists (top 3,000 items) that represent large thematic specimens of Arabic language. The specimens are arranged chronologically, staring with the earliest (right-top corner, 9&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; century) to the latest (20&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; century). The most dramatic lexical difference is between &lt;em&gt;al-Kutub al-Sittaŧ&lt;/em&gt;, the Six [Sunnī] Collections of &lt;em&gt;ḥadīṯ&lt;/em&gt;s, and &lt;em&gt;al-Šarḳ al-awsaṭ&lt;/em&gt;, the modern newspaper: the frequency lists of these two sources (again, top 3,000 items) share only 20% of word forms (tokens). Even among the “classical” works the lexical distance is quite significant, with the percentage of shared vocabulary fluctuating mainly between 38% and 58% (for the interquartile range).
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Texts compared&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;em&gt;al-Kutub al-Sittaŧ&lt;/em&gt; (2,8 mln. words), the 6 Sunnī collections of Ḥadīṯ (~9&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; century CE); &lt;em&gt;Tafsīr al-Ṭabarī&lt;/em&gt; (or &lt;em&gt;Ǧāmiʿ al-bayān&lt;/em&gt;, 3 mln. words), a commentary to the Qurʾān of al-Ṭabarī (d. 310/922 CE); &lt;em&gt;Kitāb al-Aġānī&lt;/em&gt; (1,5 mln. words), a poetic anthology of Abūl-l-Faraǧ al-Iṣbahānī (d. 356/967 CE); &lt;em&gt;al-Futūḥāt al-Makkiyyaŧ&lt;/em&gt; (1,7 mln. words), an extensive Ṣūfī text of Ibn al-ʿArabī (d. 638/1240 CE); &lt;em&gt;Fatāwá Ibn Taymiyyaŧ&lt;/em&gt; (2,9 mln. words), a collection of legal decisions and epistles of Ibn Taymiyyaŧ (d. 728/1327 CE); &lt;em&gt;Taʾrīḫ al-Islām&lt;/em&gt; (3,2 mln. words), a biographical collection and chronicle of al-Ḏahabī (d. 748/1347 CE); &lt;em&gt;Maǧallaŧ al-Risālaŧ&lt;/em&gt; (16 mln. words), an early 20&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;-century Egyptian literary journal; &lt;em&gt;Tafsīr al-Mīzān&lt;/em&gt; (2,3 mln. words), a modern Šīʿī commentary to the Qurʾān of al-Sayyid al-Ṭabāṭabāʾī (d. 1981 CE); and &lt;em&gt;al-Šarḳ al-Awsaṭ&lt;/em&gt; (2,5 mln. words), a modern Arabic newspaper (collected by Tariq Yousef from &lt;a href=&quot;http://aawsat.com/&quot; class=&quot;uri&quot;&gt;http://aawsat.com/&lt;/a&gt;).
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;description-of-the-method&quot;&gt;Description of the method&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The overall procedure is rather simple and runs as described below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Step I&lt;/em&gt;. Ḥadīṯ collections were downloaded from &lt;a href=&quot;http://sunnah.com/&quot; class=&quot;uri&quot;&gt;http://sunnah.com/&lt;/a&gt;. Then, initial texts were reformatted and normalized.&lt;a href=&quot;#fn2&quot; class=&quot;footnoteRef&quot; id=&quot;fnref2&quot;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (There are multiple way how specimens of other genres can be obtained and the processed for a similar reader).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Step II&lt;/em&gt;. All vocabulary from the corpus was collected and converted into a frequency list. This list was then converted into a ranking list, where the most frequent item receives rank 1, the second—2, the third—3, and so on; items with the same frequency are assigned the same rank. It should be noted that vocabulary items have not been parsed with a morphological analyser, so different forms of the same word are treated separately (i.e., &lt;em&gt;ḳāla&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;ḳīla&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;ḳālat&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;fa-ḳāla&lt;/em&gt;, etc. have their own frequencies and ranked separately). The main reason for not using the results of automatic morphological analysis is largely technical, since existing morphological analyzers are meant to work with modern standard Arabic and do not perform well on classical Arabic.&lt;a href=&quot;#fn3&quot; class=&quot;footnoteRef&quot; id=&quot;fnref3&quot;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; At the same time, using frequencies of word forms (tokens) rather than dictionary forms (lexemes) has its advantages, since more frequent forms will be given more frequently in the reading materials (such as, for example, very frequent &lt;em&gt;ḳāla&lt;/em&gt; [sing. masc.] vs. rather rare &lt;em&gt;ḳālā&lt;/em&gt; [dual masc.]).&lt;a href=&quot;#fn4&quot; class=&quot;footnoteRef&quot; id=&quot;fnref4&quot;&gt;&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Step III&lt;/em&gt;. The average mean of ranking values was calculated for each &lt;em&gt;ḥadīṯ&lt;/em&gt;. The resultant values then served as difficulty indices, where texts with the most frequent vocabulary would have the lowest average means, and vice versa. These indices were then used as sorting values that allowed rearranging all 34,000 &lt;em&gt;ḥadīṯ&lt;/em&gt;s by the difficulty of their vocabulary. The advantage of the average mean here is that even a single low frequency lexical item increases the difficulty index of a text, which is pushed down the list. This approach turned up a couple of unforeseen positive effects. First, as the length of a text increases so does the probability of more rare lexical items—as a result, the “easiest” texts are also the shortest ones. This convenient outcome allows students to begin with the shortest texts and move gradually to the longer ones. The second effect is that the most frequent vocabulary also tend to appear in the most frequent grammatical and syntactic structures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Step IV&lt;/em&gt;. The rearranged collections of ranked &lt;em&gt;ḥadīṯ&lt;/em&gt;s was not quite useable, since this method also groups together items that are almost the same. Here manual input was required to exclude &lt;em&gt;ḥadīṯ&lt;/em&gt;s that are too similar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Step V&lt;/em&gt;. At last, the selection of &lt;em&gt;ḥadīṯ&lt;/em&gt;s was converted into format and typeset into the reader in front of you. As you will see, quite a few &lt;em&gt;ḥadīṯ&lt;/em&gt;s in the beginning of the reader feature only &lt;em&gt;isnād&lt;/em&gt;s, “the chains of transmitters”, and do not have &lt;em&gt;matn&lt;/em&gt;s, the actual texts of &lt;em&gt;ḥadīṯ&lt;/em&gt;s. I used these &lt;em&gt;matn&lt;/em&gt;-less &lt;em&gt;ḥadīṯ&lt;/em&gt;s to introduce students to the concept of transmission of knowledge in Islamic culture, which most were not familiar with; next time around I will modify the reader to avoid having very similar texts next to each other, which can be done by the retagging of the selection of &lt;em&gt;ḥadīṯ&lt;/em&gt;s and regenerating the entire reader anew.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;in-the-classroom&quot;&gt;In the classroom&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my teaching, I used this reader in combination with ‘micropublications’, which provided each student with a thorough practice of foundational skills necessary for mastering the language: for each &lt;em&gt;ḥadīṯ&lt;/em&gt; students provided full vocalization, morphological stemming, and translation aligned with its Arabic original. Such ‘micropublications’ help monitoring students’ progress, and, later, can be used to automatically grade such assignments, thus freeing up time for in-class discussions. Last but not least, by producing these micropublications, students make a valuable contribution as they generate training data that can be used for various teaching and research purposes.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;While looking for a way to identify all biographical collections and chronicles (and, by extension, all other texts that offer data for time-series analysis) in a collection of 0ver 10,000 texts, it occurred to me that all these texts share the same common feature—they are teeming with dates. So, what if we try to identify such texts computationally?! Not only will this help us to find all relevant titles in the sea of text—without overlooking or missing anything!—we, arguably, can get an insight into the chronological coverage of each of those titles, the chronological focus of individual historians, the chronological coverage of the entire collection of historical texts, and identify texts that focus on particular periods. The blogpost begins with an overview of several digital collections and then explains the methodology of the experiment. Appendices offer one to explore the chronological coverage of about 1,000 individual texts as well as the coverage of particular periods (here,&lt;/em&gt; hijri &lt;em&gt;centuries—i.e., which texts focus on particular periods).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;introduction&quot;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Digital collections of classical Arabic texts have mushroomed over the past decade and a half. The three major libraries—&lt;em&gt;al-Ǧāmiʿ al-kabīr&lt;/em&gt; (HDD), &lt;a href=&quot;http://shamela.ws/&quot;&gt;Shamela.ws&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://shiaonlinelibrary.com/&quot;&gt;ShiaOnlineLibrary.com&lt;/a&gt;—include over 10,000 titles. There is probably another dozen collections that offer texts in hundreds and thousands (for example, &lt;a href=&quot;alwaraq.net&quot;&gt;Alwaraq.net&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;waqfeya.com&quot;&gt;Waqfeya.com&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;noorlib.ir&quot;&gt;NoorLib.ir&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ghbook.ir&quot;&gt;GhBook.ir&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://lib.eshia.ir/&quot;&gt;Lib.Eshia.ir&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://library.tebyan.net/&quot;&gt;Library.Tebyan.net&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;hathitrust.org&quot;&gt;HathiTrust.org&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.archive.org&quot;&gt;Archive.org&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Overlap among collections.&lt;/b&gt; There is significant overlap among available digital collections. Thus, while their cumulative volume may run into tens of thousands, the count of unique titles—excluding the exact copies and texts based on different editions—is significantly lower. Additionally, it is very difficult to identify duplicates among the collections. The Venn diagram above shows the overlap—over 2,000 titles—among the three major collections (the count it still work in progress). &lt;b&gt;NB&lt;/b&gt; The diagram generated with &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/benfred/venn.js/&quot;&gt;Ben Frederickson’s&lt;/a&gt; code.
&lt;/figcaption&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The number of these collections appears to be growing and their content expanding. This new research environment offers scholars an opportunity to check whether a particular text is included into in a certain collection, to browse and read it—often in a page-by-page manner—and to search for particular bits of information. These collections work well for looking for something that we know or expect to find—a book, a person, an event, a term. What we cannot do is to look into how books are related, how they overlap and complement each other; how each individual fits among his contemporaries as well as his predecessors and successors; how different historical events are intertwined; how terms, notions and concepts are related to each other and evolve across time and space. Yet, having full texts of our sources at our disposal, we can definitely go beyond simplistic linear searches. By asking a series of interconnected questions—and relying on digital methods of text analysis—we can move toward a new understanding of the entire Arabic written tradition (starting, of course, with what is digitally available in one form or another).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The question of chronology is one of such foundational questions. What I offer in this experiment is to explore the content of three such collections in order to understand better the chronological coverage of each collection, each author, and each book. In order to get insights into these issues we can turn to different kinds of data. To get a perspective on the scope of each collection we shall start with looking into descriptions of books and their authors. More specifically—into when authors died.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;metadata&quot;&gt;Metadata&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While metadata in most collections is not complete, it can still be quite useful. Major digital collections—&lt;em&gt;al-Ǧāmiʿ al-kabīr&lt;/em&gt; (HDD), &lt;a href=&quot;http://shamela.ws/&quot;&gt;Shamela.ws&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://shiaonlinelibrary.com/&quot;&gt;ShiaOnlineLibrary.com&lt;/a&gt;—display the same clear trend: strong emphasis on the period from the 3rd–6th centuries AH (912–1203 CE), with an extra peak in the 8th century (1300–1397 CE), a steady decline during the 9th–12th centuries AH (1494–1785 CE), a slow recovery during the 13th century AH (1785–1882 CE), and skyrocketing in the 14th century AH (1882–1979 CE).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note on graphs.&lt;/strong&gt; Data points of each graphed line show frequencies for periods of time that end at that point. For example, on the graph below that shows distribution of data by 100 lunar years (titles in &lt;em&gt;al-Ǧāmiʿ al-kabīr&lt;/em&gt;), the value for 300/912 CE is 280, which means that there are 280 titles written by authors who died during 200–300 AH / 815–912 CE. A &lt;a href=&quot;../images/chrono/step_before_example.png&quot;&gt;“step-before” type of graph&lt;/a&gt; displays such data most appropriately, but it is not suitable for comparative graphs, since there is too much overlap among the lines which makes the entire graph unreadable. Data on the most recent authors (after 1400/1979 CE) is excluded from the graphs, since it tends to overshadow earlier periods.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;ShiaOnlineLibrary.com&lt;/i&gt; (online)&lt;/b&gt;. The collection has a rather complete chronological metadata. Almost 1/3 of all titles are books of modern Šīʿīte scholars (excluded from the graph so that they do not overshadow earlier periods).
&lt;/figcaption&gt;

&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Alwaraq.com&lt;/i&gt; (online)&lt;/b&gt; has the most incomplete metadata, but it still suggests the same trend.
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The developers of these collections were most interested in the early Islamic period (roughly the first half of the first Islamic millennium). According to the data of such sources as the &lt;em&gt;Hadiyyaŧ al-ʿārifīn&lt;/em&gt; by Ismāʿīl Bāšā al-Baġdādī (d. 1338/1919 CE), a bibliographical collection that builds upon the famous &lt;em&gt;Kašf al-ẓunūn&lt;/em&gt; of Ḥāǧī Ḫalīfaŧ (d. 1067/1656 CE), and &lt;em&gt;Ḫizānaŧ al-turāṯ&lt;/em&gt;, a Saudi catalog of manuscripts (al-Riyāḍ: Šarikaŧ al-ʿArīs lil-Kumbiyūtir, 2007), the number of contributors to the Islamic written treasury is continuously growing at least up until the beginning of the 13th century AH.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;../images/chrono/colcov_ha_kh_authors.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;../images/chrono/colcov_ha_kh_authors.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;
&lt;b&gt;The “growth” of authors&lt;/b&gt;, according to the data from the &lt;i&gt;Hadiyyaŧ al-ʿārifīn&lt;/i&gt; and the &lt;i&gt;Ḫizānaŧ al-turāṯ&lt;/i&gt;.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Ḫizānaŧ al-turāṯ&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; is a Saudi catalog of manuscripts that was first published on a CD (al-Riyāḍ: Šarikaŧ al-ʿArīs lil-Kumbiyūtir, 2007); currently its full text is included into Shamela.ws. The catalog includes over 160,000 records, but unfortunately suffers from a number of problems, such as inconsistency of typing conventions, duplicate records, selective coverage of different manuscript collections (for example, only about 1,000 Arabic manuscripts from St.Petersburg, Russia are covered, while St.Petersburg academic institutions house at least 11,000 Arabic manuscripts).
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even though existing digital collections often awe us by their volume, the comparative graphs below shows that they cover only a fraction of the Arabic written tradition—even by comparison with an early 20th-century bibliography, which itself is hardly complete in its coverage. Additionally, the graphs also clearly highlights the fact that the chronological coverage of these collections is skewed heavily in favor of the earlier period of Islamic history.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;strong&gt;A note on the &lt;em&gt;Hadiyyaŧ al-ʿārifīn&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. The decline of both graphs after 1200/1785 CE indicates unavailability of bibliographical information to the author more than anything else. The geographical coverage of the collection starts shrinking roughly at the same period. It should be noted that most chronological datasets exhibit a similar trend. For example, the trend can be observed in al-Ḏahabī’s own &lt;i&gt;Ḏayl&lt;/i&gt; to his &lt;i&gt;Taʾrīḫ al-islām&lt;/i&gt;, where the number of biographies drops dramatically; one can equally see the same trend in Brill’s &lt;i&gt;Index Islamicus&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://library.harvard.edu/open-metadata&quot;&gt;Harvard Open Metadata (on 12 million books)&lt;/a&gt;. The only difference is that the lag gets shorter as we get closer to our time—for premodern Arabic sources this lag is 100 to 150 years; in modern datasets—10 to 20 years.
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another way to evaluate chronological coverage is too explore the actual texts. Ideally, the number of discrete units of information—such as, for example, biographies and events—by periods should show the distribution of chronological emphasis of a particular source. Furthermore, the summary of such data from all [available] titles written by a specific author should indicate this author’s interest in specific periods. (The interpretation of such “interest” is a different subject altogether. For example, the fact that the &lt;i&gt;Hadiyyaŧ al-ʿārifīn&lt;/i&gt; has more information on the 11th and the 12th centuries AH (1591–1785 CE), may indicate either Ismāʿīl Bāšā al-Baġdādī’s interest in this particular period, or the availability of information for this period, or the genuine growth in numbers of people contributing to the Islamic written treasury.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;date-statements&quot;&gt;Date Statements&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Almost none of the texts, however, are tagged in a manner that would allow to do such a detailed evaluation. Yet, it is possible to analyze date statements in each texts and offer an evaluation of their chronological coverage based on the frequencies of references to different periods. The consistency of date statements in Arabic texts—essentially, a word for “year” (&lt;em&gt;ʿām&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;sanaŧ&lt;/em&gt;) followed by either digits or spelled-out numbers—makes it possible to represent this pattern with a &lt;em&gt;regular expression&lt;/em&gt;, a special text string for describing a search pattern (see &lt;strong&gt;Figure&lt;/strong&gt; below). This &lt;em&gt;regular expression&lt;/em&gt; can be worked into a script, with which one can check available texts. It should be noted, of course, that this approach is tuned to analyze &lt;em&gt;hiǧrī&lt;/em&gt; dates, since other dating systems are used only infrequently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Words &lt;em&gt;sanaŧ&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;ʿām&lt;/em&gt; in the histories of Islam&lt;/strong&gt;. Overall, the word &lt;i&gt;sanaŧ&lt;/i&gt; is used most frequently in date statements: of about 1,362,000 date statements from across 10,000 texts only 2.9% of statements start with the word &lt;i&gt;ʿām&lt;/i&gt; (~40,000), while 97.1% begin with the word &lt;i&gt;sanaŧ&lt;/i&gt; (~1,322,000). Closer look also reveals that the word &lt;i&gt;ʿām&lt;/i&gt; is favored in texts written in the 20th century; with regards to premodern texts, it can be said that authors from the western part of the Islamic world—al-Andalus and al-Maġrib—tend to use it more frequently, than their eastern counterparts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt; Adding &lt;i&gt;fī&lt;/i&gt; “in,” into the mix changes the picture into: of about 1,670,000 statements, 79.2% start with &lt;i&gt;sanaŧ&lt;/i&gt; (~1,322,000), 18.5% with &lt;i&gt;fī&lt;/i&gt; (~308,000), and 2.4% with &lt;i&gt;ʿām&lt;/i&gt; (~40,000). The problem is that even a quick look at the ngrams of &lt;i&gt;fī&lt;/i&gt;-statements—the words that immediately follow each &lt;i&gt;fī&lt;/i&gt;-statement—shows that more than a half of these statements are quantitative phrase of different kind (for example, &lt;i&gt;fī arbaʿ mujalladāt&lt;/i&gt;). For this reason, &lt;i&gt;fī&lt;/i&gt;-statements are excluded from the analysis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

      [&lt;b&gt;Top&lt;/b&gt;] A &lt;i&gt;regular expression&lt;/i&gt; for capturing year statements in premodern Arabic sources. You can copy it and test it on some text. [&lt;b&gt;Bottom&lt;/b&gt;] The image demonstrates this &lt;i&gt;regular expression&lt;/i&gt; highlighting year statements (&lt;span style=&quot;background-color: #33FF00&quot;&gt;bright green&lt;/span&gt;) in the &lt;i&gt;Taʾrīḫ al-islām&lt;/i&gt; of al-Ḏahabī (d. 748/1347 CE). Program used: &lt;i&gt;EditPad Pro&lt;/i&gt;.
  &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Such an approach is not without its problems, of course, but it may serve well as an exploratory technique. The results of the experiment are intriguing in a number of ways, even though not entirely consistent. The most important outcome is that it allowed to discover that the collection of 10,000 texts contains only about 785 texts with more than 100 date statements per text (and since the included collections overlap, the number of unique titles is even smaller). Needless to say, that working with 785 texts is significantly easier than working with 10,000 titles. Additionally, frequencies of date statements for each text offer an opportunity to focus one’s efforts on texts that contain most data suitable for time-series analysis.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;b&gt;Choronolgical coverage.&lt;/b&gt; The graphs show the chronological coverage for the same text generated with two different approaches: while the orange dotted line represents the ideal situation—data collected through the manual tagging of the entire source, the blue solid line represents the only realistic situation—data extracted computationally. While the absolute results differ, the relative distribution is very similar and emphasizes the same periods. On the problem of the 1st century AH (622–718 CE) see below.
  &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The graph above shows two different representations of the chronological coverage of the &lt;i&gt;Hadiyyaŧ al-ʿārifīn&lt;/i&gt; by Ismāʿīl Bāšā al-Baġdādī (d. 1338/1919 CE), a bibliographical collection that builds upon the famous &lt;i&gt;Kašf al-ẓunūn&lt;/i&gt; of Ḥāǧī Ḫalīfaŧ (d. 1067/1656 CE). The blue line shows the frequencies of date statements by periods (binned into 50 year periods)—strongly suggesting more emphasis on the 11th an 12th centuries AH (1591–1785 CE). The orange dotted line shows the distribution of biobibliographical records on about 8,800 authors—this actual distribution of discrete information units in the source emphasizes the same period of the 11th and 12th centuries. The similarity in the patterns of distribution shows that reliance on computationally extracted date statements is a viable alternative.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-1st-century-problem&quot;&gt;The 1st Century Problem&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, many texts suffer from what can be characterized as “the 1st century problem”: authors often drop hundreds from date statements (authors from the second millennium also tend to drop thousands), which leads to a very high number of date statements referring—at the face value—to the 1 st century AH (622–718 CE). As a result, the 1st century often gets inflated, overshadowing other periods. The graph below illustrates this issue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;fit&quot;&gt;

&lt;img src=&quot;../images/chrono/duLamic_A.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
      Since authors often drop hundreds from their date statements, the 1st century AH gets overinflated. As the title suggests, al-Saḫāwī’s (d. 902/1496 CE) &lt;i&gt;al-Ḍawʾ al-lāmiʿ li-ahl al-ḳarn al-tāsiʿ&lt;/i&gt; focuses on the 9th century AH (1397–1494 CE), but—as the graph above shows—the number of date statements referring to the 8th (1300–1397 CE) and 9th (1397–1494 CE) centuries is significantly smaller than of those referring to the 1st century (notice the gap in between!). It is clear that al-Saḫāwī is dropping hundreds from his date statements. The problem is that some of those statements may refer to the 8th century, while some others to the 9th, so moving them all to the 9th century is hardly a solution.
  &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;!--
The same pattern is even more clear in some sources that deal with the second millenium, as we can see in _Ḫulāṣaŧ al-aṯar fī aʿyān al-ḳarn al-ḥādī ʿašar_ of al-Muḥibbī (d. 1111 AH) [**Top right**], _Silk al-durar fī aʿyān al-ḳarn al-ṯānī ʿašar_ of al-Murādī (d. 1206 AH) [**Bottom left**], and _Ḥilyaŧ al-bašar fī taʾrīḫ al-ḳarn al-ṯāliṯ ʿašar_ of al-Bayṭār (d. 1337 AH) [**Bottom right**], where authors drop thousands from date statements. These texts, however, are not the most problematic, since the scope declared in their titles hints to what period incomplete dates are likely to belong to. It is clear that dates for the 2nd and 3rd centuries actually refer to the 12th and the 13th centirues respectively; “the 1st century” date statements, unfortunately, may refer to any century within the scope of a particular title. 
--&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The problem may be resolved through the sequential analysis of date statements in texts. Authors are not likely to drop hundreds from their statements without letting their readers know what century they are talking about. In other words, an incomplete date statement must be preceded by a complete one. Thus, one can check if there are other date statements—and if there is, the incomplete date can be fit into the period of the preceding statement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The actual implemented algorithm grabs a 100-word chunk before a 1st-century date statement and checks if there are other date statements in that chunk. The procedure is repeated up to five times, that is checking up to 500 words—an equivalent of 1 to 3 printed pages—before the date statement in question, until either the text limit is reached or a date statement found. If a date statement is found, its century gets applied to the starting date statement that we treated as incomplete. In other words, if we start with “the year 65”, and we find “the year 530” preceding it, we change the first date into “the year 565” (1169 CE). If the preceding date is also from the 1st century, the starting date remains unchanged; the date also remains unchanged, if no other date statements have been found. Additionally, the algorithm runs in two different ways—in the first case, it does not build on updated date statements (Lines B); while in the second, it does, extrapolating from corrected date statements (Line C). The graph below shows the results.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;fit&quot;&gt;

&lt;img src=&quot;../images/chrono/duLamic_ABC.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
 &lt;figcaption&gt;
      The graph shows new results for al-Saḫāwī’s (d. 902/1496 CE) &lt;i&gt;al-Ḍawʾ al-lāmiʿ li-ahl al-ḳarn al-tāsiʿ&lt;/i&gt;: &lt;b&gt;A&lt;/b&gt; (&lt;i&gt;solid blue line&lt;/i&gt;) shows unmodified date statements (as in the previous graph); &lt;b&gt;B&lt;/b&gt; (&lt;i&gt;dotted orange line&lt;/i&gt;) shows the results of the first run of the algorithm—over 2,800 statements were updated, but there is still a lot of dates for the 1st century; &lt;b&gt;C&lt;/b&gt; (&lt;i&gt;dashed green line&lt;/i&gt;) shows the results of the second run of the algorithm, which builds on the updated dates—almost 12,000 date statements were redistributed, now clearly showing that the book is about 9th century.&lt;br /&gt;
      &amp;emsp;&lt;b&gt;Note:&lt;/b&gt; a6675 is the identifier of a particular version of the text—title #6675 from &lt;i&gt;al-Maktabaŧ al-Š&lt;b&gt;ā&lt;/b&gt;milaŧ&lt;/i&gt;; the same title from a different collection will have a different identifier.
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The question is, of course, how reliable such projections are. In order to check this we need to compare algorithmically produced results with manually disambiguated data. The graphs below show such comparisons for four different sources: &lt;strong&gt;A&lt;/strong&gt; (&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#F88017;&quot;&gt;orange dotted&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;) shows the initial results of computational date statements collection; &lt;strong&gt;B&lt;/strong&gt; (&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:green;&quot;&gt;green dashed&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;)—modified dates without extrapolation; &lt;strong&gt;C&lt;/strong&gt; (&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#C11B17;&quot;&gt;red dashed&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;)—modified results with extrapolation; and, finally, &lt;strong&gt;D&lt;/strong&gt; (&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#2B547E;&quot;&gt;blue solid&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;)—shows manually disambiguated 1st-century date statements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;al-wafayāt-al-aʿyān-of-ibn-Ḫallikān-d-6811282-ce&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;al-Wafayāt al-aʿyān&lt;/em&gt; of Ibn Ḫallikān (d. 681/1282 CE)&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;img src=&quot;../images/chrono/manual_wafayatABCD.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Results for Ibn Ḫallikān’s &lt;em&gt;al-Wafayāt al-aʿyān&lt;/em&gt; are very good—algorithmically modified dates are very close to manually disambiguated. Results of Algorithm B—modified results without  extrapolation—are slightly closer to the benchmark (line D) than the results of Algorithm C. Yet, both are somewhat “overfitting” 1st-century dates. Good news: algorithmic lines B and C lead to the same conclusion as the benchmark Line D—Ibn Ḫallikān covers the period of 450–650 AH / 1058–1252 CE most thoroughly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;al-kāmil-fī-l-taʾrīḫ-of-ibn-aṯīr-d-6301232-ce&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;al-Kāmil fī-l-taʾrīḫ&lt;/em&gt; of Ibn Aṯīr (d. 630/1232 CE)&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;img src=&quot;../images/chrono/manual_kamilABCD.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Results for Ibn Aṯīr’s &lt;em&gt;al-Kāmil fī-l-taʾrīḫ&lt;/em&gt; are less precise: both algorithms overfitted 1st-century dates, inflating other centuries, if compared to manually disambiguated data (D). The peaks of distribution—the shape of the curve—are much closer to the benchmark than the preprocessed results (A), but computational analysis suggests that Ibn Aṯīr focuses more on the later period, while (according to manually disambiguated data) his attention is spread more evenly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;Ṭabaḳāt-al-šāfiʿiyyaŧ-of-ibn-Ḳāḍī-Šuhbaŧ-d-8511447-ce&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ṭabaḳāt al-šāfiʿiyyaŧ&lt;/em&gt; of Ibn Ḳāḍī Šuhbaŧ (d. 851/1447 CE)&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;img src=&quot;../images/chrono/manual_tshk_05_ABCD.png&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Results for the &lt;em&gt;Ṭabaḳāt al-šāfiʿiyyaŧ&lt;/em&gt; of Ibn Ḳāḍī Šuhbaŧ are not ideal, but still much better than the initial results. Extending the check range from 500 words to 1,000 gets the graph—line C in particular—much closer to the benchmark (click on the image to see the graph based on the extended range of 1,000 words). The problem, however, is that for other sources 1,000-word range does not generate better results.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;some-general-observations&quot;&gt;Some general observations&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are clearly not getting 100% match with the benchmark, but that is not to be expected anyway—none of the exploratory computational methods work that way. Our model does not take into account the stylistic differences among authors. While the ballpark of date statements do fall into the proposed pattern there are occasionally slight variations that are peculiar to particular authors. Some of such peculiarities may be helpful. For example, Ibn Ḫallikān often uses phrases &lt;em&gt;li-l-hiǧraŧ&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;min al-hiǧraŧ&lt;/em&gt; with the true 1st-century date statements (which is still 75-80%)—and such markers can be worked into the algorithm; other authors—about half a dozen that I checked thoroughly—use such additional phares only occasionally. Other peculiarities are too complicated and cannot be resolved with simple algorithms. For example, Ibn Ḳāḍī Šuhbaŧ occasionally “spells” out ones in his date statements to ensure that his readers get it right: &lt;em&gt;sanaŧ sabʿ &lt;strong&gt;bi-taḳdīm al-sīn&lt;/strong&gt; wa-ʿišrīn …&lt;/em&gt;, “the year seven, with &lt;em&gt;sīn&lt;/em&gt; in the beginning…”), which, again, breaks the general pattern for date statements. The most complicated issue, however, is that even for a scholar it may occasionally be difficult to figure what century a certain date refers to (for example, when a biographee was born close to the middle of one century and died close to the middle of the next one). Natural languages will always pose such difficulties, yet, the results produced with the offered approach are quite suitable for the goal: even when we do not get the exact results, we are still getting close enough to the benchmark for a useful distant reading of a large corpus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The precision of results also varies because of differencies in book structure. We get more precise projections for books organized alphabetically—in this case authors cannot afford to use too many incomplete dates (see graphs for the &lt;em&gt;Hadiyyaŧ al-ʿārifīn&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Wafayāt al-aʿyān&lt;/em&gt; above); and less precise for books organized chronologically. It would make sense to develop different subroutines for processing texts based on their organization. Having robust metadata on each text would help triggering analytical routines adjusted to various peculiarities, although the structure of a book can be inferred computationally (on this see below). Additionally, a more precise logic can be implemented if our texts are properly divided into logical units. Thus, in a book organized alphabetically, the analysis of dates would be limited to a single logical unit, while in a book organized chronologically the precision of analysis can be inforced by looking into date statements in the neighboring units. At this point, results are provocatively suggestive—but in most cases some familiarity with a specific book will help make sense of its graphs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;complementary-coverage-of-continuations&quot;&gt;Complementary coverage of “continuations”&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Date statements may also offer other useful insights into Arabic historical sources. Comparing chronological coverage of different texts may offer an illustration of how text related to each other. Graphs below show a few examples of how certain texts are overlapping chronologically with their “continuations” (&lt;em&gt;ḏayl&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;takmilaŧ&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;ṣilaŧ&lt;/em&gt;) and are complemented by them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;date-statements-and-the-structure-of-books&quot;&gt;Date statements and the structure of books&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Patterns of date statements distribution across texts—in other words, if we graph dates in the order they occur in a text—can also tell us a lot about the structural organization of books. As the illustrations below show, alphabetical and chronological structures have distinct visual patterns. Such patterns can be helpful in assessing new corpora and identifying texts relevant for specific research purposes. Different routines can be developed for the identification and analysis of texts of other forms and genres.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note on graphs below:&lt;/strong&gt; Each line represents a date statement, where the length of the line corresponds to the year that a date statement refers to. The left side of each graph is the beginning of the book; the right one—its end. Regression analysis—here visualized with the red line for linear regression, and the blue one for LOWESS regression—can be used for identifying the patterns of distribution without graphing. (1st-century dates were removed to make patterns more clear.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

  &lt;/figcaption&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;concluding-remarks&quot;&gt;Concluding remarks&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One thing that must be voiced is that if we had a corpus properly prepared by scholars and for scholars that would include robust metadata and texts tagged into logical units, the results of such an experiment would have been significantly more precise and reliable, not to mention that such a corpus would also allow to run a number of other exploratory experiments. To put it differently, we—scholars who study the premodern Islamic world, and who are actively using collections developed in Arab countries and Iran for non-academic purposes (and let’s be honest, most of us do)—must invest time and effort into the development of a digital library that would allow all of us to engage in methodologically novel research. Such a library would also allow to build on the each other’s research more consistently, which would also help to forge a new collaborative culture that will be beneficial to the entire field.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;appendix-i-exploring-coverage-of-historical-sources&quot;&gt;Appendix I: Exploring coverage of historical sources&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;a href=&quot;../projects/chronoplot/chronoCoverageNew.html&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;../images/chrono/chronoplot.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can explore the chronological coverage of historical texts using &lt;a href=&quot;../projects/chronoplot/chronoCoverageNew.html&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Chronoplot&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (it may take a moment to load). Current data includes about 3,000 texts (including versions of the same text from different libraries). Keep in mind the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Each text has a unique identifier: &lt;em&gt;letter + number&lt;/em&gt;, where the former refers to a collection, and the latter—to the number of a text in that collection:
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;j&lt;/strong&gt; — &lt;em&gt;al-Ǧāmiʿ al-kabīr&lt;/em&gt;;&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;a&lt;/strong&gt; — &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://shamela.ws/&quot;&gt;al-Maktabaŧ al-Šāmilaŧ&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;;&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;i&lt;/strong&gt; — &lt;a href=&quot;http://shiaonlinelibrary.com/&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;al-Maktabaŧ al-Šīʿiyyaŧ&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Each text has three variations of date statement distribution. (Consider comparing variations for the text with the same identifier.) Texts of the same title from different collections occasionally give different distributions (especially when electronic texts are based on different printed editions).
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A&lt;/strong&gt; — unmodified dates (“1st century problem”);&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;B&lt;/strong&gt; — updated dates (“single pass”);&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;C&lt;/strong&gt; — updated dates (”double pass”)&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Selector&lt;/em&gt; (right) can be used to select titles for graphing their chronological coverage. Choosing multiple titles will allow to compare their coverages.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Filter&lt;/em&gt; (right top) can be used to find specific titles: type a part of an author’s name or a book’s title, and the list will be filtered to show only items that have your keywords.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Linetype&lt;/em&gt; (right bottom) is a drop-down menu that offers several ways graphing the results. The most appropriate linetype for displaying chronological coverage is “step-before,” since it shows the frequencies of date statements per 50-year periods in the most clear manner. However, this works well only for single texts. For comparative purposes “monotone” seems to be a better option.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;appendix-ii-exploring-coverage-of-historical-periods&quot;&gt;Appendix II: Exploring coverage of historical periods&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The table below lists sources by frequencies of date statements. Like &lt;em&gt;Chronoplot&lt;/em&gt;, this table also has three variations of each text (A, B, C). Since variations A, B, and C differ only in how dates are distributed across periods, the initial table shows only variation A. Selecting a particular century will show only texts (with variations) that have dates for those periods.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Metadata on texts is not always complete. The missing information may be available online—where applicable, links to the online manifestations of texts are provided.&lt;/p&gt;

So, what if we try to identify such texts computationally?! Not only will this help us to find all relevant titles in the sea of text—without overlooking or missing anything!—we, arguably, can get an insight into the chronological coverage of each of those titles, the chronological focus of individual historians, the chronological coverage of the entire collection of historical texts, and identify texts that focus on particular periods. The blogpost begins with an overview of several digital collections and then explains the methodology of the experiment. Appendices offer one to explore the chronological coverage of about 1,000 individual texts as well as the coverage of particular periods (here, hijri centuries—i.e., which texts focus on particular periods).</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Introducing OpenArabic mARkdown</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/2015/11-08.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Introducing OpenArabic mARkdown" /><published>2015-11-08T00:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2015-11-08T00:00:00+01:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/2015/mARkdown</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/2015/11-08.html">&lt;p&gt;TEI XML has long become the standard for tagging humanistic texts for research purposes. It is the standard in most digital libraries (including the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/&quot;&gt;Perseus Digital Library&lt;/a&gt;). Having texts in a TEI XML format that conforms to the standards of a long-standing library allows one to take advantage of libraries’ infrastructure and analytical tools that have been developed since the appearance of TEI XML. Converting texts into XML, however, is a rather long and complicated process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Texts in Arabic make things even more complicated. Right-to-left (RTL) and left-to-right (LTR) text in one file is one the major challenges. Since the cursor changes the direction of its movement when crossing the boundary between RTL and LTR text, it is difficult to place the cursor properly, and one often ends up changing a wrong part of the text. The direction of paired characters is visually confusing, and it is often next to impossible to say whether a given angle bracket—perhaps the most important XML character—is an opening character or a closing one. Moreover, the shapes of Arabic letters in a text file are dynamically changing as one types or edits Arabic text, and many text editors do not handle this properly (particularly on Mac). In addition to these technical challenges, there are too many Arabic texts to convert—and most of them are multivolume titles—and too few people who have both training and willingness to do that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the beginning of my digital research I have considered TEI XML as a working format, but I had to give up on this option, since converting a 50-volume book (~3,4 million words) would have taken forever. After reviewing existing approaches, I came up with a rather simple tagging system that allowed me to create a structured, machine-readable text, without sacrificing years of my life. In many ways, this system was inspired by &lt;a href=&quot;https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/&quot;&gt;markdown&lt;/a&gt;—“a text-to-HTML conversion tool … that allows [one] to write using an easy-to-read, easy-to-write plain text format, then convert it to structurally valid XHTML (or HTML).”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main goal of &lt;strong&gt;mARkdown&lt;/strong&gt; is to provide a simple system for tagging structural elements in Arabic texts that would facilitate algorithmic analysis in the same way as more complex TEI XML does. In principle, &lt;strong&gt;mARkdown&lt;/strong&gt; does not require any special editor, but my current workflow relies on EditPad Pro, which supports right-to-left languages, Unicode, and large files. However, it is the support of custom highlighting and navigation schemes that makes this text editor particularly convenient for &lt;strong&gt;mARkdown&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since I have been using my &lt;strong&gt;mARkdown&lt;/strong&gt; for my own research purposes, it has not yet been developed into an easily reusable system. This is my first attempt to provide a detailed description and explain how it can be used. I expect that &lt;strong&gt;mARkdown&lt;/strong&gt; will undergo some minor changes in the upcoming months. The most recent description can be accessed from the main menu above.&lt;/p&gt;

Yet envy is precisely what an early Islamicist feels when he reads Roger Bagnall and Bruce Frier’s &lt;em&gt;The Demography of Roman Egypt&lt;/em&gt;.” &lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:fn1&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:fn1&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; These words stuck in my head since the very moment I read them and over the past two years of working among and with the classicists my classics envy has been growing—on top of 300 original census declarations that were at the disposal of of the above mentioned scholars, there are way too many things to envy, especially when it comes to all things digital.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;http://pleiades.stoa.org/&quot;&gt;Pleiades Gazetteer&lt;/a&gt; is a particularly interesting case: with almost 35,000 places, it offers several well-populated categories of geographical objects. The categories include settlements, forts, temples, villas, stations, [amphi]theaters, churches, bridges, baths, cemetaries, plazas, archs. What makes it even more interesting is that most of these objects have chronological markers, i.e. they belong to one or more of the following periods: archaic (750–550BC), classical (550–330BC), hellenistic-republican (330–30BC), roman (30BC–300CE), late-antique (300–640CE).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This data offers a opportunity for an interesting digital exersize with historical data. I assigned it to my students as a part of introduction to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.r-project.org/&quot;&gt;R&lt;/a&gt; (within my “Introduction to Text Mining for the Students of Humanities”, Tufts University, Spring 2015). The task was to explore the Pleiades data set, find out what is what and what can be done with it. The goal was to discover that 1) geographical objects are categorized, and that 2) they also have chronological markers, which can be used 3) to maps the geography of the Greco-Roman world over time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The map of forts turned out to be particularly interesting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fastest and easiest way to animate the results is to use &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.imagemagick.org/&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ImageMagick&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a free command-line utility. The following command will take all &lt;strong&gt;.png&lt;/strong&gt; files whose names begin with &lt;strong&gt;Pleiades_Settle&lt;/strong&gt; and convert them into an animated GIF file &lt;strong&gt;Pleiades_Settlements.gif&lt;/strong&gt;, which will play continuously (&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;-loop 0&lt;/code&gt;), with each frame downsized (&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;-resize 1200x900&lt;/code&gt;) and paused for .75 of a second (&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;-delay 75&lt;/code&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;convert -resize 1200x900 -delay 75 -loop 0 Pleiades_Settle*.png Pleiades_Settlements.gif

Yet envy is precisely what an early Islamicist feels when he reads Roger Bagnall and Bruce Frier’s The Demography of Roman Egypt.” 1 These words stuck in my head since the very moment I read them and over the past two years of working among and with the classicists my classics envy has been growing—on top of 300 original census declarations that were at the disposal of of the above mentioned scholars, there are way too many things to envy, especially when it comes to all things digital.

&lt;p&gt;Done to avoid issues with Alpheios translation alignment, which automatically splits supplied texts into words. Essentially, combinations with “.” and “:” are replaced with “*” and “=” respectively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;=t&lt;/strong&gt; is &lt;em&gt;tāʾ marbūṭaŧ&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;*s&lt;/strong&gt; is &lt;em&gt;ṣād&lt;/em&gt; (and the same for other letters transliterated with dots)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;why-betacode&quot;&gt;Why BetaCode?&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although both Windows and Mac OS now support Arabic, it is still quite difficult to type and edit Arabic texts. It is particularly frustrating to edit and manipulate fully vocalized texts, since most fonts either render “short vowels” (&lt;em&gt;ḥarakāt&lt;/em&gt;) invisible, or do not render them properly. Because of the “stacking,” i.e. “short vowels” being placed on top of letters and on top of each other, it becomes impossible to &lt;em&gt;edit&lt;/em&gt; texts and one is often forced to go into delete-and-retype mode (and there is still no guarantee, because of visual issues, that all the letters and “short vowels” will actually be in the right order). &lt;strong&gt;betaCode&lt;/strong&gt; can make it easy to type fully-vocalized Arabic texts on any machine through the use of simple character combinations and automatic rendering into various transliteration schemes and the Arabic script (scroll below for examples).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;betaCode&lt;/strong&gt; is first converted into a one-to-one transliteration scheme, which combines conventions from various academic transliteration schemes. Such scheme is necessary, since none of the existing academic schemes (American/Library of Congress, British, French, German, etc.) allow representing Arabic text unambiguously for computational purposes. Arabic &lt;strong&gt;betaCode&lt;/strong&gt; transliteration can be then converted into any transliteration convention. At the moment the following schemes are implemented:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Library of Congress Romanization of Arabic&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Simplified transliteration (LOC without diacritics)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Arabic script (the rules of &lt;em&gt;hamzaŧ&lt;/em&gt; orthography are implemented, but may require some additional testing)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;NB:&lt;/strong&gt; The idea of &lt;strong&gt;betaCode&lt;/strong&gt; is borrowed from the Classicists who developed &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beta_Code&quot;&gt;“a method of representing, using only ASCII characters, characters and formatting found in ancient Greek texts”&lt;/a&gt;. The current &lt;strong&gt;betaCode&lt;/strong&gt; is inspired by, and is therefore quite similar to, the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www2.informatik.uni-stuttgart.de/ivi/bs/research/arab_e.htm&quot;&gt;arabTex scheme&lt;/a&gt;. Linguists working with Arabic are commonly using &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buckwalter_transliteration&quot;&gt;Buckwalter transliteration&lt;/a&gt;, which is very similar to the current betaCode, but less readable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;basic-principles&quot;&gt;Basic principles:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every Arabic letter is betaCoded with its one-letter equivalent,
preceded (if necessary) with a technical character that is similar to a diacritical mark in the transliterated version. Thus, most common symbols are as follows:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;general&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;General&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;_&lt;/strong&gt; (underscore), if a letter can be transliterated with &lt;em&gt;macron&lt;/em&gt;/&lt;em&gt;breve&lt;/em&gt; below or above (&lt;em&gt;ā&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;ṯ&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;ḫ&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;ḏ&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;ū&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;ī&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt; (period), or  &lt;b&gt;*&lt;/b&gt; (asterisk), if a letter can be transliterated transliterated with &lt;em&gt;dot&lt;/em&gt; below or above (&lt;em&gt;ḥ&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;ṣ&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;ḍ&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;ṭ&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;ẓ&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;ġ&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;ḳ&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;^&lt;/strong&gt; (caret), if a letter can be transliterated with &lt;em&gt;caron&lt;/em&gt; (&lt;em&gt;ǧ&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;š&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;specifics&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Specifics&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;attached prepositions/conjunctions and pronominal suffixes must be separated with “-” (mostly relevant for text alignment, treebanking,  and general readability):
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;bi-Llah?i &lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;fa-_dahaba&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;add “?” before “optional” final vowels that are usually dropped in transliteration and pronounciation (mostly relevant  for transliteration):
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;bi-Llah?i &lt;/code&gt;, but not:&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;fa-_dahaba&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;tāʾ marbūṭaŧ&lt;/em&gt;: add “+” after &lt;em&gt;tāʾ marbūṭaŧ&lt;/em&gt;, if the first word of &lt;em&gt;iḏāfaŧ&lt;/em&gt; (mostly relevant for transliteration):
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;`_amma:t+u Ba.gd_ada&lt;/code&gt;, but:&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;al-`_amma:tu f_i Ba.gd_ada&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

It is particularly frustrating to edit and manipulate fully vocalized texts, since most fonts either render “short vowels” (*ḥarakāt*) invisible, or do not render them properly. Because of the “stacking,” i.e. “short vowels” being placed on top of letters and on top of each other, it becomes impossible to *edit* texts and one is often forced to go into delete-and-retype mode (and there is still no guarantee, because of visual issues, that all the letters and “short vowels” will actually be in the right order). **betaCode** can make it easy to type fully-vocalized Arabic texts on any machine through the use of simple character combinations and automatic rendering into various transliteration schemes and the Arabic script (scroll below for examples).</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Islamic Urban Centers (661–1300 CE)</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/2014/08-23.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Islamic Urban Centers (661–1300 CE)" /><published>2014-08-23T00:00:00+02:00</published><updated>2014-08-23T00:00:00+02:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/2014/islamic-urban-centers-661-1300</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/2014/08-23.html">&lt;p&gt;Back to al-Ḏahabī’s &lt;em&gt;Taʾrīḫ al-islām&lt;/em&gt;. The present dynamic cartogram shows how the prominence of major urban centers was changing over time. The focus is again on “descriptive names” (&lt;em&gt;nisbaŧ&lt;/em&gt;) and the “size” of each urban center on the cartogram reflects the number of individuals with “descriptive names” that refer to that urban center. A “prominent center” in the current dataset is a place with which at least 10 individuals from &lt;em&gt;Ta’rīḫ al-islām&lt;/em&gt; are associated&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#footnote_0_1096&quot; id=&quot;identifier_0_1096&quot; class=&quot;footnote-link footnote-identifier-link&quot; title=&quot; The nature of *nisbaŧ*s is not unproblematic and anyone who has worked with biographical collections is likely to object saying that, for example not every individual identified as “al-Madanī” was actually a Medinan; besides there definitely are Medinans who are not identified as such with this specific toponymic nisba, not to mention that the “descriptive name” al-Madanī (and its variation al-Madīnī) may refer to urban centers other than Medina. (See, for example, al-Samʿānī (1998), 5:235–239.) While such objections are not invalid, at this point of our knowledge and understanding of the overabundant biographical data from Arabic sources we simply do not know to what extent the presence of false positives (i.e., Madanīs who have nothing to do with Medina) and the absence of false negatives (i.e., the Medinans who are not identified as Madanīs) actually affects the overall picture. Working with big data requires some clearly identified methodological assumptions regarding the types of data used in modeling. My computational analysis of data from the &amp;lt;i&amp;gt;Taʾrīḫ al-islām&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt; yields about 700 unique *nisbaŧ*s (with over 300 toponymic ones) that identify at least 10 different individuals, while the overall number of these nisbas runs into over 70,000 instances, considering that individuals are often described with more than one nisba. While 70,000 data points can hardly be called &amp;ldquo;big data&amp;rdquo; by any scientific standards, this dataset is too big to make exact identification of each and every nisba possible. Thus, under these circumstances, treating nisbas at their face values is simply the most logical way to begin large scale analysis of biographical data from Arabic sources; as our knowledge about the “behavior” of nisbas in biographical collections improves—and this can be achieved only through large-scale exploratory analysis—these methodological assumptions can and will be adjusted. For the detailed discussion of methodological assumptions see, Romanov (2013), 28—40.&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; (the overall number of individuals in the current dataset is slightly over 29,000 for the period of 661–1300 CE). Each frame features the names of the top 15 urban centers (the largest among them gradually change their hue from green to red).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The cradle of Islam, central Arabia is the most prominent region in the early period. Major urban centers of this region are Mecca/Makkaŧ (269) and Medina/al-Madīnaŧ (691), but their cultural prominence soon shifts to the main garrison cities of lower Iraq: Kufa/al-Kūfaŧ and Basra/al-Baṣraŧ. The decline of central Arabia starts around 100/719 CE and by 250/865 CE this region is diminished to a marginal province. (The south Arabian cluster displays a similar trend.)&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;b&gt;Major Early Bloomers:&lt;/b&gt; Medina/al-Madīnaŧ (691); Kufa/al-Kūfaŧ (1,432), and Basra/al-Baṣraŧ (1,595).
	&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Iraq very quickly becomes the central region and maintains this status for the most of the period covered in &lt;em&gt;Taʾrīḫ al-islām&lt;/em&gt;. During the early period its prominent urban centers are Basra/al-Baṣraŧ (1,595) and Kufa/al-Kūfaŧ (1,432), but the prominence of these garrison towns is soon dwarfed by Baghdad, the new capital city, and they practically disappear from the social map of the Islamic world by around 300/913 CE. Baghdad remains the dominant urban center not only for Iraq, but for the entire Islamic world until the beginning of the 13&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; century CE. Other major urban centers of this region are Wāsiṭ (401) and al-Anbār (83).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rapid growth of Iraq comes to a halt around 200/816 CE—at this period the Caliphate is being torn apart by the civil war between al-Amīn and al-Maʾmūn, the sons of great Hārūn al-Rašīd (r. 786-809 CE), who decided to divide the Empire between them. The province falls into clearly visible decline. In the course of the 9&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; century the power slips from the ʿAbbāsid caliphs: first into the hands of the military commanders of their slave armies, then—the Būyids (932-1055 CE) and the Saljūqs (1038-1194 CE).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;480/1088 CE marks the beginning of a century-long recovery for Iraq—the ʿAbbāsid caliphs gradually manage to shake off the ‘‘protectorship” of the military (at this point, the Saljūq &lt;em&gt;sulṭān&lt;/em&gt;s) and temporarily regain their independence. Caliphs, &lt;em&gt;sulṭān&lt;/em&gt;s, and viziers (&lt;em&gt;wazīr&lt;/em&gt;) vie for for influence with each other, seeking the support of religious scholars and relying on various mechanisms of promoting different legal schools—respectively, the Ḥanbalīs, the Ḥanafīs, and the Šāfiʿīs. The data from &lt;em&gt;Taʾrīḫ al-islām&lt;/em&gt; shows that it is during this period that these groups start growing quite noticeably.&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;b&gt;The number of Baġdādīs&lt;/b&gt; drops quite noticeably before the Mongol sack of the capital city in 656/1258 CE. Numbers of deaths reported for the 20-lunar-year periods after 600/1204 CE: 244 for 600-620 AH/1204-1224 CE CE; 256 for 621-640 AH/1225-1243 CE; 98 for 641-660 AH/1244-1262 CE CE; 27 for 661-680 AH/1263-1282 CE CE; 51 for 681-700 AH/1283-1301 CE.
	&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By the end of the period covered in &lt;em&gt;Taʾrīḫ al-islām&lt;/em&gt;, Iraqi élites drastically decrease in numbers, practically disappearing from the social map of the Islamic world. Although the Mongol invasion is often considered the main cause, the data from &lt;em&gt;Taʾrīḫ al-islām&lt;/em&gt; shows that the ranks of Iraqi élites start thinning well before the coming of the Mongols. Despite these vicissitudes, the number of notable men in Iraq remains quite significant over the most part of our period, and the prominence of Iraq is rivaled only by Iran, with all its clusters combined.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Major “middle bloomers,” Iranian provinces gain prominence between 100/719 CE and 200/816 CE. The curve of northeastern Iran (Ḫurāsān) reaches its highest point quite quickly around 200/816 CE and remains there, fluctuating slightly, for over three centuries, and goes into a rapid decline after 520/1127 CE. It takes longer for northwestern Iran to reach its peak—around 350/962 CE—and then it slowly goes down. Unlike northeastern Iran, it is still visible on the maps of the Islamic world by the end of our period. The curve of southwestern Iran reaches its highest point around 280/894 CE, then goes into a temporary decline during the 4&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;/10&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; century, recovers by 400/1010 CE and begins to go down slowly, increasing its pace of decline around 520/1127 CE. The major urban centers are: Nishapur/Naysābūr (1,038), Merv/Marw [al-šāhijān] (385), Herat/Harāŧ (392), Balkh/Balḫ (171) and Ṭūs (136) in northeastern Iran (Ḫurāsān); Rey/al-Rayy (280), Hamaḏān (254) and Qazwīn (118) in northwestern Iran; and Isfahan/Iṣbaḥān (1,124) and Šīrāz (100) in southwestern Iran.&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The curves of Iranian clusters correspond to what scholars of Islam often refer to as ‘‘Iranian intermezzo”,&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#footnote_1_1096&quot; id=&quot;identifier_1_1096&quot; class=&quot;footnote-link footnote-identifier-link&quot; title=&quot;The term was introduced by Vladimir Minorsky (Minorsky (1953), 110-116).&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; a period of Iranian independent dynasties (roughly 750-1150 CE): the Ṭāhirids (821-873), Ṣaffārids (867-903) and Sāmānids (875-999) in the east and the Būyids (932-1055) in the north and west. All Iranian clusters practically come to naught by the end of the period covered in &lt;em&gt;Taʾrīḫ al-islām&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The two-peaked curve of the last “middle bloomer,” al-Andalus, seems to correspond to the zenith of the Umayyad caliphate in Spain (756-1031 CE) around 380/991 CE, followed by its disintegration and the recovery under the Almoravids/al-Murābiṭūn (1056-1147 CE) and the Almohads/al-Muwaḥḥidūn (1130-1269 CE)—beginning around 470/1078 CE and peaking around 590/1195 CE; after that Andalusia is erased from the map of the Islamic world by the Christian Reconquista. The major Andalusian urban centers are Cordova/Qurṭubaŧ (633), Seville/Išbīliyyaŧ (248), Valencia/Balansiyyaŧ (141) and Toledo/Ṭulayṭilaŧ (89).&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regional clusters that can be characterized as “late bloomers” often have earlier peaks of prominence: around 100/719 CE for Syria, when the first great Islamic dynasty, the Umayyads (661-750 CE), rules from there; around 200/816 CE for the Jazīraŧ and Jordan; and around 300/913 CE for Egypt—followed by equally noticeable decline until around 500/1107 CE. However, their main peaks of prominence fall on the end of the period, by which the “late bloomers” form what can be considered as one continuous crescent-shaped macro-region stretching from Egypt/Miṣr in the south, through Jordan/al-Urdunn, Syria/al-Šām, the Jazīraŧ/Upper Mesopotamia, the northern part of Iraq, the very south of the Caucasian cluster in the north, and even touches northwestern Iran (Zanjān). The prominence of these regions rises noticeably after 500/1107 CE—right at the onset of the rule of dynasties that unify the region: the Zangids (1127-1222 CE), the Ayyūbids (1169-1250 CE), and the Mamlūks (1250-1517 CE). The major urban centers are: Mosul/al-Mawṣil (313) and Ḥarrān (224) in the Jazīraŧ; Damascus/Dimašq (1,769), Homs/Ḥimṣ (268), Aleppo/Ḥalab (231) and Hamah/Ḥamāŧ (103) in Syria; Jerusalem/al-Quds (315) in Jordan; and Alexandria/al-Iskandariyyaŧ (211) in Egypt/Miṣr.&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#footnote_2_1096&quot; id=&quot;identifier_2_1096&quot; class=&quot;footnote-link footnote-identifier-link&quot; title=&quot;Cairo/al-Qāhiraŧ is not yet identifiable through onomastic data; most individuals from Egypt have the nisba al-Miṣrī (1,501) that associate them with the entire province. Although this nisba may also refer to Cairo, at the moment it does not appear possible to differentiate efficiently.&quot;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; By the end of the main period covered in the &lt;em&gt;Taʾrīḫ al-islām&lt;/em&gt;, Syria becomes the new center of the Islamic world, with Egypt being next in the line.&lt;/p&gt;

    The nature of &lt;em&gt;nisbaŧ&lt;/em&gt;s is not unproblematic and anyone who has worked with biographical collections is likely to object saying that, for example, not every individual identified as “al-Madanī” was actually a Medinan; besides there definitely are Medinans who are not identified as such with this specific toponymic &lt;em&gt;nisbaŧ&lt;/em&gt;, not to mention that the “descriptive name” al-Madanī (and its variation al-Madīnī) may refer to urban centers other than Medina. (See, for example, &lt;strong&gt;al-Samʿānī (1998), 5:235–239&lt;/strong&gt;.) While such objections are not invalid, at this point of our knowledge and understanding of the overabundant biographical data from Arabic sources we simply do not know to what extent the presence of false positives (i.e., Madanīs who have nothing to do with Medina) and the absence of false negatives (i.e., the Medinans who are not identified as Madanīs) actually affects the overall picture. Working with big data requires some clearly identified methodological assumptions regarding the types of data used in modeling. My computational analysis of data from the &lt;em&gt;Taʾrīḫ al-islām&lt;/em&gt; yields about 700 unique &lt;em&gt;nisbaŧ&lt;/em&gt;s (with over 300 toponymic ones) that identify at least 10 different individuals, while the overall number of these &lt;em&gt;nisbaŧ&lt;/em&gt;s runs into over 70,000 instances, considering that individuals are often described with more than one &lt;em&gt;nisbaŧ&lt;/em&gt;. While 70,000 data points can hardly be called “big data” by any scientific standards, this dataset is too big to make exact identification of each and every &lt;em&gt;nisbaŧ&lt;/em&gt; possible. Thus, under these circumstances, treating &lt;em&gt;nisbaŧ&lt;/em&gt;s at their face values is simply the most logical way to begin large scale analysis of biographical data from Arabic sources; as our knowledge about the “behavior” of &lt;em&gt;nisbaŧ&lt;/em&gt;s in biographical collections improves—and this can be achieved only through large-scale exploratory analysis—these methodological assumptions can and will be adjusted. For the detailed discussion of methodological assumptions see, &lt;strong&gt;Romanov (2013), 28–40&lt;/strong&gt;.  [&lt;a href=&quot;#identifier_0_1096&quot; class=&quot;footnote-link footnote-back-link&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;]

Even with very extensive Appendices, several thousand graphs and maps still did not make it into the dissertation. Hopefully, if I can find enough time, I will make an online appendix with the visualizations of all generated data that consists mainly of chronological graphs of “descriptive names” and chronological maps that show how their geographies were changing over time (all based on “The History of Islam” of al-Ḏahabī (d. 1348)).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;abstract&quot;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A project in the digital humanities, the dissertation explores methods of computational text analysis. Relying on text-mining techniques to extract meaningful data from unstructured text, the study offers an effective and flexible method for the analysis of Arabic biographical collections, the most valuable source for the social history of the pre-modern Islamic world. It uses the largest collection, “The History of Islam” of al-Ḏahabī (d. 1348), as a case-study of applying the new method and shows how almost 30,000 biographies can be studied as a whole. A step toward finding a viable solution for studying the entire digital corpus of classical Islamic texts (400 mln. words), Chapter I offers a detailed explanation of “computational reading” that was built upon existing digital approaches from a variety of disciplines. Chapter II models big data extracted from the main source to further our understanding of the social geography of the Islamic world and its major social transformations, simultaneously providing an important background for the next chapter. Chapter III applies the devised method to the study of Islamic preaching from chronological, geographical and social perspectives that have been overlooked in the academic treatment of this subject. Largely an exploratory overview, it traces long-term changes in preaching practices as well as statuses of preachers within the Islamic elites. This chapter demonstrates how exactly computational reading can contribute to the studies of specific phenomena and practices. The final section overviews broad prospects of the further application of “computational reading” to a variety of genres of pre-modern Arabic literature. The dissertation heavily relies on the visual display of information in the form of graphs, charts, maps, and tables that are used in the main body and supplied in Appendices.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Maxim Romanov</name><email>romanov.maxim@gmail.com</email></author><category term="Blogpost" /><category term="Graphs" /><category term="Maps" /><category term="Research" /><category term="al-Ḏahabī" /><category term="Ta’rīḫ al-islām" /><summary type="html">A project in the digital humanities, the dissertation explores methods of computational text analysis.

  &lt;i&gt;All models are false, but some are useful&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt; George P. Box
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;why-models&quot;&gt;Why Models?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The advent of digital humanities&lt;/strong&gt; has brought the notion of “big data” into the purview of humanistic inquiry. Humanists now have access to huge corpora that open research possibilities that were unthinkable a decade or two ago. However, working with corpora requires a rather different approach that is more characteristic of sciences than humanities. Namely, one has to be transparent and explicit with regard to how data are extracted and how they are analyzed. Text-mining techniques rely on explicit algorithms because they help tracing mistakes, correcting them and, ultimately, improving results.&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#footnote_0_918&quot; id=&quot;identifier_0_918&quot; class=&quot;footnote-link footnote-identifier-link&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Analytical procedures for studying extracted data rest on explicit algorithms for the same reason. As a way of constructing algorithms, modeling is part and parcel of developing complex computational procedures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Working with big data also requires a different kind of modeling. Opting for the breadth of data we have to give up the richness of details. Close reading—to which humanists are most accustomed—becomes impossible.&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#footnote_1_918&quot; id=&quot;identifier_1_918&quot; class=&quot;footnote-link footnote-identifier-link&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Working with big data one cannot maintain the nuanced complexity of details that became the hallmark of close reading as an approach. Instead of relying on complex textual evidence and reading between the lines one has to work with relatively simple textual markers—essentially, words or simple phrases—that are treated as indicators of large trends. Yet, it is through such analysis that we can look into long-term and large-scale processes that will always remain beyond the scope of close reading. The literary historian Franco Moretti dubbed such an approach “distant reading, ” explaining distance” not as an obstacle, but &lt;em&gt;a specific form of knowledge&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#footnote_2_918&quot; id=&quot;identifier_2_918&quot; class=&quot;footnote-link footnote-identifier-link&quot;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; With emphasis on fewer elements that allows us to get a sharper sense of their overall interconnection, we can distinguish shapes, relations, structures. Most importantly, we can trace small changes over long periods of time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Modeling is an important part of this approach. With models we simplify reality down to a limited number of factors&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#footnote_3_918&quot; id=&quot;identifier_3_918&quot; class=&quot;footnote-link footnote-identifier-link&quot;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; through the analysis of which we hope to get insights into complex processes.&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#footnote_4_918&quot; id=&quot;identifier_4_918&quot; class=&quot;footnote-link footnote-identifier-link&quot;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; This simplification is the reason why &lt;em&gt;all models are false&lt;/em&gt;. Yet, models are a valuable and powerful tool. They pave the way to improving our understanding of the world. Unlike theories, models are experimental and driven by data. Good models offer invaluable glimpses into the subjects of our inquiry.&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#footnote_5_918&quot; id=&quot;identifier_5_918&quot; class=&quot;footnote-link footnote-identifier-link&quot;&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; With them we can explore, explain, project. With them we can get a big picture. That is why &lt;em&gt;some models are useful&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What follows is an attempt to model Islamic élites based on the data from al-Ḏahabī’s (d. 748/1348 CE) &lt;em&gt;Taʾrīḫ al-islām&lt;/em&gt; in order to explore major social transformations that the Muslim community underwent in the course of almost seven centuries of its history. The main types of data used in the model are dates, toponyms,&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#footnote_6_918&quot; id=&quot;identifier_6_918&quot; class=&quot;footnote-link footnote-identifier-link&quot;&gt;7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; linguistic formulae (or, wording patterns), synsets (lists of words that point to a specific concept or entity), and, most importantly, “descriptive names” (sing. &lt;i&gt;nisbaŧ&lt;/i&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The detailed discussion of main assumptions regarding these types of data as well as the discussion of such general issues relevant to the study of Arabic biographical collections can be found elsewhere.&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#footnote_7_918&quot; id=&quot;identifier_7_918&quot; class=&quot;footnote-link footnote-identifier-link&quot;&gt;8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Here it is most important to dwell on our assumptions regarding “descriptive names” that are regarded by some scholars as the most valuable kind of data that literary sources offer to the social historian of the Islamic world, and by others as highly problematic as such. The major problem with &lt;i&gt;nisbaŧ&lt;/i&gt;s is that it is not always clear what they stand for. For example, if an individual is described in a biographical collection as &lt;i&gt;ṣaffār&lt;/i&gt;, does this actually mean that he was involved in “copper smithing”? When our subject is just one particular individual, it is not so difficult to establish the more or less exact meaning of this descriptive name by cross-examining biographies of this individual in other biographical collections. This is particularly easy now when dozens of electronic texts of biographical collections are just few mouse-clicks away. However, such an approach becomes problematic when this rather time-consuming procedure has to be repeated for dozens of individuals. The approach becomes particularly difficult if our goal is to study some biographical collection in its entirety, since Arabic biographical collections often contain thousands of biographies and most biographies offer multiple descriptive names for the same individual. After a certain threshold it becomes impossible to apply this approach at all. Our source, &lt;em&gt;Taʾrīḫ al-islām&lt;/em&gt;, is well beyond this threshold. In the analysis that will follow, we will deal with the dataset of almost 70,000 &lt;i&gt;nisbaŧ&lt;/i&gt;s (with about 700 unique ones) that represent about 26,000 individuals over the period of 41–700/1301 CE. Working with such a dataset one cannot possibly know the exact meaning of each and every &lt;i&gt;nisbaŧ&lt;/i&gt;. At the same time we do not have any solid foundation to argue that descriptive names are to be treated in a particular manner, or to be discarded altogether. Yet, such a dataset is too unique an opportunity for research to ignore simply because we are not entirely sure what all these data mean. This is where modeling offers an optimal solution: we need to start with assumptions and be upfront about them. In what follows, descriptive names will be treated at their face value, if only because this is the most logical starting point.&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#footnote_8_918&quot; id=&quot;identifier_8_918&quot; class=&quot;footnote-link footnote-identifier-link&quot;&gt;9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-source-al-Ḏahabīs-taʾrīḫ-al-islām&quot;&gt;The Source: al-Ḏahabī’s &lt;em&gt;Taʾrīḫ al-islām&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Taʾrīḫ al-islām&lt;/em&gt; is the largest Arabic biographical collection that includes over 30, 000 biographies and covers almost seven centuries of Islamic history. The current dataset includes information on slightly over 29, 000 individuals (the first three volumes of &lt;em&gt;Taʾrīḫ al-islām&lt;/em&gt; are structured differently from the rest of the collection and cannot be studied with the same computational method). Figure &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; shows cumulative biographical graphs and curves based on this data set. Biographies are grouped into 20 lunar year periods (quantities of biographies for each period are shown at the bottom of the &lt;i&gt;Biographical graph&lt;/i&gt;). The graph is transformed into a curve that smooths out the noise of data, emphasizing larger trends (&lt;em&gt;Smoothed Biographical Curve&lt;/em&gt;). Finally, the main curve is the &lt;em&gt;Adjusted Biographical Curve&lt;/em&gt;, which is shifted 30 years back in time to reflect “the years of floruit” of the biographees from &lt;em&gt;Taʾrīḫ al-islām&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;fit&quot;&gt;
	&lt;a href=&quot;http://localhost:4000/images/tamfih/TI_UpdCumulativeCurve.jpg&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://localhost:4000/images/tamfih/TI_UpdCumulativeCurve.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
	&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;b&gt;Figure 1.&lt;/b&gt; Cumulative Biographical Curve. The row of numbers shows the quantities of biographies per 20 lunar year periods, beginning with 41-60 AH/662-681 CE and up to 680-700 AH/1282-1301 CE.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The curve can be split into several periods, each beginning at a point that marks a noticeable diversion of the curve. The number of biographies keeps on growing quite rapidly until &lt;em&gt;c.&lt;/em&gt; 160/778 CE, which marks the slowing of growth. During &lt;em&gt;c.&lt;/em&gt; 270-470 AH/884-1078 CE there is a steady decline. After &lt;em&gt;c.&lt;/em&gt; 470/1078 CE the curve starts recovering, reaching its highest point around &lt;em&gt;c.&lt;/em&gt; 570/1175 CE, after which it keeps on growing, but slows its pace by the end of the period—with the second peak being somewhere after 700/1301 CE. For convenience, many of the graphs that will follow will include the scaled-down cumulative curve and color-coded periods.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;modeling-society&quot;&gt;Modeling Society&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The individuals whose lives are described in biographical collections were not ordinary people. They were integrated into the life of society to a noticeable degree—somewhere on the scale from noteworthy to extraordinary. Almost every biographical note contains some information on a sphere of life to which its protagonist contributed—and “descriptive names” is the most manageable indicator of this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Major studies that use “descriptive names” for analytical purposes split them into categories. Cohen’s classic study&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#footnote_9_918&quot; id=&quot;identifier_9_918&quot; class=&quot;footnote-link footnote-identifier-link&quot;&gt;10&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; concentrates primarily on “secular occupations” during the first four centuries of Islamic history. He offered a major division of occupational &lt;i&gt;nisbaŧ&lt;/i&gt;s (textiles, foods, ornaments/perfumes, paper/books, leather/metals/wood/clay, miscellaneous trades, general merchants, bankers/middlemen) and supplied an extensive appendix with explanations for about 400 &lt;i&gt;nisbaŧ&lt;/i&gt;s and relevant linguistic formulae. Unfortunately, the &lt;i&gt;nisbaŧ&lt;/i&gt;s in Cohen’s appendix are not explicitly categorized and—since any categorization involves pushing the boundaries, especially in instances that stubbornly resist classification—the exact scheme remains somewhat unclear.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Petry’s scheme is built on biographical data from Mamlūk Egypt (1258–1517 CE). Petry divided his subjects into six major, often overlapping occupational groups: executive and military professions, bureaucratic (secretarial-financial) professions, legal professions, artisan and commercial professions, scholarly and educational professions, and religious functionaries. Although explicit classification is not given in the “Glossary of Occupational Terms, ” numerous tables provide enough information to form a rather clear idea about the specifics of each category in Petry’s classification scheme.&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#footnote_10_918&quot; id=&quot;identifier_10_918&quot; class=&quot;footnote-link footnote-identifier-link&quot;&gt;11&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shatzmiller approached this issue from the much wider perspective of labor in general. Her scheme covers a much wider variety of occupational names and splits the entire society into three major sectors—extractive, manufacturing, services—with each sector having its overlapping subcategories. Schatzmiller offers an explicit categorization of each and every descriptive name.&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#footnote_11_918&quot; id=&quot;identifier_11_918&quot; class=&quot;footnote-link footnote-identifier-link&quot;&gt;12&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As is the case with any scheme, all three examples are designed to serve specific purposes. Although immensely helpful, none of them are suitable for the purposes of broader analysis: unlike the above-mentioned schemes, the scheme needed here must take into account &lt;i&gt;all&lt;/i&gt; meaningful descriptors, not only those that can be classified as “occupations.” In other words, it must consider anything that would allow discerning all potentially identifiable groups so that their evolution could be traced. Some of these descriptors do not pose significant problems, others are so complex that even presenting them as ideal types might be highly problematic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The list of “descriptive names” from &lt;em&gt;Taʾrīḫ al-islām&lt;/em&gt; is based on frequencies and for the moment I consider &lt;i&gt;nisbaŧ&lt;/i&gt;s that are used to qualify at least ten individuals (slightly over 700 unique &lt;i&gt;nisbaŧ&lt;/i&gt;s, with their total running up to almost 70,000 instances). My list of descriptive names overlaps only partially with those of Cohen, Petry and Shatzmiller. Figure &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt; shows how the categories of “descriptive names” from &lt;em&gt;Taʾrīḫ al-islām&lt;/em&gt; are interconnected from the individual perspective.&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;b&gt;Figure 3.&lt;/b&gt; Hierarchical Connections of the Middle Layer.
	&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The innermost layer of categories includes &lt;b&gt;trib&lt;/b&gt;al, &lt;b&gt;topo&lt;/b&gt;nymic, &lt;b&gt;ethn&lt;/b&gt;ic and &lt;b&gt;phys&lt;/b&gt;ical descriptions. These are descriptors over which individuals have the least control—in a sense that no one chooses into which &lt;b&gt;trib&lt;/b&gt;e to be born, where to be born, what &lt;b&gt;ethn&lt;/b&gt;ic group to belong to, and what &lt;b&gt;phys&lt;/b&gt;ical peculiarities to have or suffer from. To a certain degree these description are also acquirable—in the early period being a Muslim meant being affiliated with an Arab &lt;b&gt;trib&lt;/b&gt;e; individuals were constantly moving around the Islamic world, changing their &lt;b&gt;topo&lt;/b&gt;nymic affiliations; &lt;b&gt;phys&lt;/b&gt;ical peculiarities could have resulted from life experience. However, these are only probable—and thus secondary—cases that would usually be piled up on top of primary, “by-birth” descriptions. The first three categories—&lt;b&gt;trib&lt;/b&gt;al, &lt;b&gt;topo&lt;/b&gt;nymic, &lt;b&gt;ethn&lt;/b&gt;ic—also tend to overlap.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The middle layer groups “descriptive names” in terms of acquirable qualities—&lt;b&gt;trade&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;knowl&lt;/b&gt;edge, &lt;b&gt;posit&lt;/b&gt;ition and &lt;b&gt;statu&lt;/b&gt;s. These are not categories that rest on the same level and their connections are better represented in an hierarchical manner (Figure &lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt;). The main gateways to élites were &lt;b&gt;trade&lt;/b&gt;s (or “secular occupations”) and &lt;b&gt;knowl&lt;/b&gt;edge[s]. However, practicing some &lt;b&gt;trade&lt;/b&gt; alone was almost never enough: biographical collections rarely—if ever—include individuals who were involved exclusively in some specific “secular occupation.” In order to climb up the social ladder a practitioner of any &lt;b&gt;trade&lt;/b&gt; had to start converting his economic capital into social—this was most commonly done through acquiring religious &lt;b&gt;knowl&lt;/b&gt;edge. &lt;b&gt;Knowl&lt;/b&gt;edge—as specialized training in a specific area that would set an individual aside from the masses—opened ways for acquiring &lt;b&gt;posit&lt;/b&gt;ions and &lt;b&gt;statu&lt;/b&gt;s[es]; it could also allow one to practice &lt;b&gt;trade&lt;/b&gt; on a new level, thus improving individual’s &lt;b&gt;statu&lt;/b&gt;s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The outermost layer represents the major sectors to which a person could belong in pre-modern Islamic society: &lt;b&gt;relig&lt;/b&gt;ious, &lt;b&gt;admin&lt;/b&gt;istrative, &lt;b&gt;milit&lt;/b&gt;ary, and “&lt;b&gt;civil&lt;/b&gt;ian.” The term “civilian” is problematic, and is used here essentially as a negative blanket category that encompasses everything that does not clearly belong to the first three sectors. Descriptive names often cross boundaries among these categories and most individuals do not clearly belong to one specific sector, but rather balance among them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For our purposes it will be more efficient to invert this scheme so that “descriptive names” are presented from the social perspective (Figure &lt;b&gt;4&lt;/b&gt;). Now, each category contributes to the composition of Islamic society, and every “descriptive name” can be seen as a social role. These roles are likely to receive a centripetal charge from individuals who attempt to expand their influence on society at large; how close they get to the center—i.e., how much social influence they can exercise—would depend on the success of particular individuals and/or historical circumstances that might be favorable to particular groups. Social influence here is understood broadly as a pressure that forces someone to do something that s/he otherwise would not have done; at this point I do not make a distinction between physical threats and social pressures. Clearly, the sword of an &lt;i&gt;amīr&lt;/i&gt;, “military commander, ” and the word of a &lt;i&gt;šayḫ&lt;/i&gt;, “religious authority, ” are different in their nature, but both may have equally serious societal consequences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Figures &lt;b&gt;5&lt;/b&gt; &lt;em&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/em&gt; &lt;b&gt;6&lt;/b&gt; should provide a visual clue to how these overlapping categories are used in the classification scheme. On Figure &lt;b&gt;5&lt;/b&gt;: &lt;i&gt;amīr&lt;/i&gt;, “governor, commander, ” and &lt;i&gt;sulṭān&lt;/i&gt;, “sultan, ” both belong to the &lt;b&gt;milit&lt;/b&gt;ary sector of society. &lt;i&gt;Amīr&lt;/i&gt; can be seen primarily as a &lt;b&gt;posit&lt;/b&gt;ion—in a sense that there is somebody above who granted this &lt;b&gt;posit&lt;/b&gt;ion to a given individual; arguably, this &lt;b&gt;posit&lt;/b&gt;ion provides one with a relatively high &lt;b&gt;statu&lt;/b&gt;s. &lt;i&gt;Sulṭān&lt;/i&gt; is the apex of the &lt;b&gt;milit&lt;/b&gt;ary hierarchy and thus is primarily seen as &lt;b&gt;statu&lt;/b&gt;s with significant influence over all other sectors. &lt;i&gt;Kātib&lt;/i&gt;, “scribe, ” and &lt;i&gt;wazīr&lt;/i&gt;, “vizier, prime minister, ” belong to the &lt;b&gt;admin&lt;/b&gt;istrative sector, where the former is a &lt;b&gt;posit&lt;/b&gt;ion with potential for social influence, while the latter is the apex of the &lt;b&gt;admin&lt;/b&gt;istrative hierarchy, which gives one significant resources to influence society at large—hence, it is also &lt;b&gt;statu&lt;/b&gt;s.&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#footnote_12_918&quot; id=&quot;identifier_12_918&quot; class=&quot;footnote-link footnote-identifier-link&quot;&gt;13&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Somewhat an equivalent to &lt;i&gt;amīr&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;raʾīs&lt;/i&gt;, “chief, director, ” is a denomination of high &lt;b&gt;statu&lt;/b&gt;s in either the &lt;b&gt;civil&lt;/b&gt;ian, the &lt;b&gt;relig&lt;/b&gt;ious or the &lt;b&gt;admin&lt;/b&gt;istrative sector (also &lt;b&gt;posit&lt;/b&gt;ion in the latter). &lt;i&gt;Ṭabīb&lt;/i&gt;, “physician, ” stands for special training—&lt;b&gt;knowl&lt;/b&gt;edge—within the &lt;b&gt;civil&lt;/b&gt;ian sector, which is also likely to fall into the categories of &lt;b&gt;trade&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;posit&lt;/b&gt;ion, especially after hospitals (sing. &lt;i&gt;bimaristān&lt;/i&gt;) become a constant element of the Muslim cityscape.&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#footnote_13_918&quot; id=&quot;identifier_13_918&quot; class=&quot;footnote-link footnote-identifier-link&quot;&gt;14&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;i&gt;Qaṭṭān&lt;/i&gt;, “producer or seller of cotton, ” and &lt;i&gt;qawwās&lt;/i&gt;, “bow-maker, ” are both secular occupations—&lt;b&gt;trade&lt;/b&gt;s—and thus belong to the &lt;b&gt;civil&lt;/b&gt;ian sector, although the latter—if bows are produced for war-making purposes—may cross into the &lt;b&gt;milit&lt;/b&gt;ary one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Figure &lt;b&gt;6&lt;/b&gt;: &lt;i&gt;Šayḫ&lt;/i&gt;, literally “elder, ” and &lt;i&gt;imām&lt;/i&gt;, “leader, ” are the markers of the highest &lt;b&gt;relig&lt;/b&gt;ious &lt;b&gt;statu&lt;/b&gt;s, although in the later period &lt;i&gt;imām&lt;/i&gt; also refers to a &lt;b&gt;relig&lt;/b&gt;ious &lt;b&gt;posit&lt;/b&gt;ion of “prayer leader” that was only marginally influential in social terms. &lt;i&gt;Faqīh&lt;/i&gt; refers to &lt;b&gt;knowl&lt;/b&gt;edge of Islamic law, whereas social influence is exerted primarily through other roles, such as &lt;i&gt;qāḍī&lt;/i&gt;, “judge, ” which is always a &lt;b&gt;posit&lt;/b&gt;ion—or &lt;i&gt;muftī&lt;/i&gt;, “juristconsult, ” which turns into a &lt;b&gt;posit&lt;/b&gt;ion in the later period (not graphed). &lt;i&gt;Ḥāfiẓ&lt;/i&gt; denotes &lt;b&gt;knowl&lt;/b&gt;edge of Prophetic tradition and high achievement (&lt;b&gt;statu&lt;/b&gt;s) within this area of &lt;b&gt;relig&lt;/b&gt;ious expertise. &lt;i&gt;Muḥtasib&lt;/i&gt;, “market inspector, ” is an &lt;b&gt;admin&lt;/b&gt;istrative &lt;b&gt;posit&lt;/b&gt;ion with strong &lt;b&gt;relig&lt;/b&gt;ious underpinnings. Last on the list are &lt;i&gt;ḫaṭīb&lt;/i&gt;, “Friday preacher, ” and &lt;i&gt;wāʿiẓ&lt;/i&gt;, “public preacher.” Both belong to the &lt;b&gt;relig&lt;/b&gt;ious sector, but while the former is always a &lt;b&gt;posit&lt;/b&gt;ion, the latter refers to a specific field of religious &lt;b&gt;knowl&lt;/b&gt;edge that tends to become a &lt;b&gt;posit&lt;/b&gt;ion only during the later period.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Individuals in the Islamic biographical dictionaries usually wear many turbans and are qualified with more than one “descriptive name.” Using the same method, each individual can be represented as a unique constellation of &lt;b&gt;trade&lt;/b&gt;s, &lt;b&gt;knowl&lt;/b&gt;edge[s], &lt;b&gt;posit&lt;/b&gt;ions and &lt;b&gt;statu&lt;/b&gt;s[es] that are fitted into the diagram of the four major sectors. Pushing this approach even further, we may try to evaluate how the composition of Islamic élites—and, possibly, society at large—changed over time, although conventional graphs may be more efficient for this task.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;looking-into-major-sectors&quot;&gt;Looking into Major Sectors&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Introducing the categories of sectors—&lt;b&gt;milit&lt;/b&gt;ary, &lt;b&gt;admin&lt;/b&gt;istrative, &lt;b&gt;relig&lt;/b&gt;ious and &lt;b&gt;civil&lt;/b&gt;ian—I hope to use them as markers of change within the composition of Islamic élites. Society would remain healthier when more social groups are represented in the élites, since a more diverse population will be participating in the [re]negotiation of the rules of the game. This is what the share and the diversity of the civilian sector—with a number of trades, crafts and knowledge[s]—is meant to represent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;half&quot;&gt;
	&lt;a href=&quot;http://localhost:4000/images/tamfih/TI_BiosMajorSectors_ABS.jpg&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://localhost:4000/images/tamfih/TI_BiosMajorSectors_ABS.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Figure &lt;b&gt;7&lt;/b&gt; shows the cumulative curves of all four sectors. Although this is still work in progress and algorithms for determining the administrative and military sectors still need adjustment, the curves do agree with the major trends that we expect to be confirmed by quantitative analysis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The religious sector keeps on growing throughout the period. Occasional fluctuations notwithstanding, it hits the 60% mark by the end of the period. One would expect this number to be higher, but a significant number of individuals participated in the transmission of knowledge without specializing in specific fields of religious learning and thus did not not earn relevant &lt;i&gt;nisbaŧ&lt;/i&gt;s. This, of course, may result from irregularities in naming practices or the lack of verbal patterns in my synsets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The civilian sector is at its highest during 300-400 AH/913-1010 CE, when it reaches a 30% share. By the end of the period it goes down to 20%. The number of individuals involved in trades and crafts is about 24-25% at its highest point around 400/1010 CE and goes down to 13-14% by the end of the period.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The administrative and military sectors are not as significant in terms of numbers, but the representatives of these sectors are in better positions to make the most immediate and most striking impact on society at large. Both sectors keep on growing, although while the growth of the administrative sector is constant, albeit rather slow, the growth of the military sector is quite remarkable, especially after 500/1107 CE. Overall, the share of the military sector could have been reaching up to 10% during the later periods, which is very significant considering that at some earlier periods this sector is lacking altogether. The administrative sector may have hit the mark of about 8% during the later periods.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;De-tribalization&lt;/strong&gt; is one of the most striking processes that the onomastic data show. Islamic society starts as a tribal society with up to 85% of individuals in the earliest periods qualified through tribal affiliations. As the Islamic community grows and spreads over the Middle East and North Africa, the number of individuals with tribal identities rapidly goes down (Figure &lt;b&gt;8&lt;/b&gt;) and by about 350/962 CE only 20–25% of the individuals in the &lt;em&gt;Taʾrīḫ al-islām&lt;/em&gt; have tribal affiliations. From this point on—perhaps even earlier—tribal affiliations persevere in different capacities: some as dynastic (most prominently, the &lt;i&gt;nisbaŧ&lt;/i&gt; al-Umawī that spikes again after 350/962 CE in Andalusia), but in most cases as status markers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;fit&quot;&gt;

Although al-Anṣār, “The Helpers [of the Prophet], ” are not exactly a tribe, this group, being a product of the tribal society of Arabia, in many ways functioned as such.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Such &lt;i&gt;nisbaŧ&lt;/i&gt;s as al-Anṣārī (Figure &lt;b&gt;9&lt;/b&gt;) and al-Qurašī (Figure &lt;b&gt;10&lt;/b&gt;) make quite a noticeable comeback. The numbers of al-Anṣārīs (this &lt;i&gt;nisbaŧ&lt;/i&gt; is particularly frequent in Andalusia as well) begin to grow quite rapidly after 350/962 CE and the number of al-Qurašīs practically skyrockets right after 500/1107 CE. However, even though their absolute numbers are much higher in the later periods, their percentages never reach their early peaks: the highest peak of al-Anṣārīs in the earliest periods is 18.32%, while the highest one in the later periods is only 6.53%; with al-Qurašīs these numbers are 8.42% and 3.31%. Some other tribal &lt;i&gt;nisbaŧ&lt;/i&gt;s are re-claimed as well, but the overall number of individuals with names that associate them with Arab tribes remains rather low, only briefly going above the 30% mark.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most tribal &lt;i&gt;nisbaŧ&lt;/i&gt;s display rather distinctive orientations toward the East or the West of the Islamic world. “Late bloomers” are most often oriented toward the West (Figure &lt;b&gt;11&lt;/b&gt;). For example, such &lt;i&gt;nisbaŧ&lt;/i&gt;s as al-Qaysī (208) and al-Laḫmī (183) feature most prominently in Andalusia (84 al-Qaysīs and 83 al-Laḫmīs); al-Tujībī (127)—in Andalusia (57) and Egypt (46); al-Maḫzūmī (182)—in Egypt (33);&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#footnote_14_918&quot; id=&quot;identifier_14_918&quot; class=&quot;footnote-link footnote-identifier-link&quot;&gt;15&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; al-Saʿdī (191)—in Egypt (50) and Syria (25). But again, the percentages of “late bloomers” never reach those of the earlier periods.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The change in tribal identities can also be seen through the numbers of unique tribal &lt;i&gt;nisbaŧ&lt;/i&gt;s per period (Figure &lt;b&gt;12&lt;/b&gt;). In general, they display a similar trend. At its highest the number of unique tribal &lt;i&gt;nisbaŧ&lt;/i&gt;s fluctuates at around 115 during the period 100-200 AH/719-816 CE. It drops to about 60 by 500/1107 CE and then grows back to about 80—most likely through the re-appropriation of old tribal &lt;i&gt;nisbaŧ&lt;/i&gt;s that are now used as status markers as well as through the introduction of Turkic and Kurdish tribal identities—but by the end of the main period this number goes down to the 60–70 range.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Militarization.&lt;/strong&gt; Onomastic data from &lt;em&gt;Taʾrīḫ al-islām&lt;/em&gt; allows us to take a closer look at the process characterized by Hodgson as “perhaps the most distinctive feature of the Middle Islamic periods.”&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#footnote_15_918&quot; id=&quot;identifier_15_918&quot; class=&quot;footnote-link footnote-identifier-link&quot;&gt;16&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; The absolute numbers on Figure &lt;b&gt;13&lt;/b&gt; (left) show that the military sector of élites begins to grow rapidly after 500/1107 CE—the numbers of &lt;i&gt;amīr&lt;/i&gt;s included in the &lt;em&gt;Taʾrīḫ al-islām&lt;/em&gt; are staggering.&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#footnote_16_918&quot; id=&quot;identifier_16_918&quot; class=&quot;footnote-link footnote-identifier-link&quot;&gt;17&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Geographically, this spike of militarization is clearly visible in Iraq, the Jazīraŧ, Egypt, but in Syria more than anywhere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The relative numbers in Figure &lt;b&gt;13&lt;/b&gt; (right) allow for a more detailed glimpse into how the military were treated by the learned class who composed biographical collections that became sources of al-Ḏahabī’s “History.” And the percentages tell a somewhat different story. Interestingly, the turning points of the military curve coincide with those of the cumulative biographical curve. The military curve, however, has three clearly visible sections, or periods. The first section, the early period up until 270/884 CE, shows the decline of the military in Islamic society. This process of de-militarization went on hand-in-hand with de-tribalization, during which the diversity of the Islamic community grew, the ethos changed and swords and horses were exchanged for pens and donkeys. 270/884 CE is the first peak of the cumulative biographical curve: the highest percentage of the learned and the lowest percentage of the military in the &lt;em&gt;Taʾrīḫ al-islām&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;half&quot;&gt;
	&lt;a href=&quot;http://localhost:4000/images/tamfih/TI_BiosMilitarySector_ABS.jpg&quot; title=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://localhost:4000/images/tamfih/TI_BiosMilitarySector_ABS.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

	&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;b&gt;Figure 13.&lt;/b&gt; The Military Sector in &lt;i&gt;Taʾrīḫ al-islām&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the middle period of 270-570 AH/884-1175 CE, when the cumulative biographical curve takes a dive and then, after 470/1078 CE, begins to recover, the share of the military in &lt;em&gt;Taʾrīḫ al-islām&lt;/em&gt; grows slowly. This can be marked as the beginning of [re-]militarization of Islamic élites. Unlike in the early period, however, now the &lt;i&gt;amīr&lt;/i&gt;s are not Arab[ian] warriors, but Turkic military commanders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After 570/1175 CE—when the cumulative curve recovers and continues growing further—the percentage of military commanders in the élites begins to grow as rapidly as their absolute numbers. This third period shows a successful integration of the military into the élites and the their numbers strongly suggest that religious scholars take even minor commanders seriously.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Military commanders do a lot to make a place for themselves in the dense social space of the Islamic society: as their biographies show, they build &lt;i&gt;madrasaŧ&lt;/i&gt;s, hospitals (&lt;i&gt;bimāristān&lt;/i&gt;) and establish other &lt;i&gt;waqf&lt;/i&gt; institutions. More and more often they participate in the transmission of knowledge, which scholars report.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The military—the &lt;i&gt;amīr&lt;/i&gt;s themselves and members of their families&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#footnote_17_918&quot; id=&quot;identifier_17_918&quot; class=&quot;footnote-link footnote-identifier-link&quot;&gt;18&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;—are not the only ones building &lt;i&gt;madrasaŧ&lt;/i&gt;s and, judging by the frequencies of their mentions, their establishments are not the most prominent. However, they definitely compensate for this in numbers: there are significantly more endowments established by the military than by members of other groups.&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#footnote_18_918&quot; id=&quot;identifier_18_918&quot; class=&quot;footnote-link footnote-identifier-link&quot;&gt;19&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Figure &lt;b&gt;14&lt;/b&gt; shows the curves of the most frequently mentioned &lt;i&gt;madrasaŧ&lt;/i&gt;s in &lt;em&gt;Taʾrīḫ al-islām&lt;/em&gt;. The vizieral al-Niẓāmīyaŧs and the caliphal al-Mustanṣirīyaŧ feature more prominently. However, their curves strongly suggest that their prime time is over, while “military” &lt;i&gt;madrasaŧ&lt;/i&gt;s—al-Ẓāhirīyaŧ, al-Amīnīyaŧ, al-Nāṣirīyaŧ, al-Nūrīyaŧ, al-ʿĀdilīyaŧ and al-Qaymarīyaŧ and others—are on the rise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The “Fulān al-dīn” honorifics that in the earlier periods were reserved for religious scholars become very common among the military, while the old pattern of “Fulān al-dawlaŧ” practically disappears (see Figure &lt;b&gt;15&lt;/b&gt;).&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#footnote_19_918&quot; id=&quot;identifier_19_918&quot; class=&quot;footnote-link footnote-identifier-link&quot;&gt;20&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; It is not entirely clear whether these names are given to the military by religious scholars or if they are self-claimed (most likely both), but the fact that the military are listed under these honorifics in biographical collections implies that at the very least religious scholars endorsed them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;half&quot;&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Frequencies of such words as &lt;em&gt;ḫalīfaŧ/amīr al-muʾminīn&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;i&gt;sulṭān&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;amīr&lt;/i&gt; in biographies show that the 4th/10th century was a the period (Figure &lt;b&gt;16&lt;/b&gt;) when scholarly attention started shifting from caliphs to &lt;i&gt;sulṭān&lt;/i&gt;s and &lt;i&gt;amīr&lt;/i&gt;s who were gaining more power and more social presence. This shift in frequencies also neatly marks the end of the period which Hodgson characterized as the High Caliphal Period (in his chronology: &lt;em&gt;c.&lt;/em&gt; 692-945 CE),&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#footnote_20_918&quot; id=&quot;identifier_20_918&quot; class=&quot;footnote-link footnote-identifier-link&quot;&gt;21&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; and the beginning of the Earlier Middle Islamic Period (in his chronology: &lt;em&gt;c.&lt;/em&gt; 945-1258 CE): the era of &lt;i&gt;sulṭān&lt;/i&gt;s and &lt;i&gt;amīr&lt;/i&gt;s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;De-civilianization&lt;/strong&gt;. As was noted above, the share of the civilian sector noticeably decreases after 400/1010 CE. The diversity of crafts and trades within the civilian sector (Figure &lt;b&gt;17&lt;/b&gt;) reaches its highest point around 300/913 CE, when 85 different trades and crafts are represented.&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#footnote_21_918&quot; id=&quot;identifier_21_918&quot; class=&quot;footnote-link footnote-identifier-link&quot;&gt;22&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; After 300/913 CE the diversity goes down, getting to the 60s range by the end of the period.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looking closer into trades and crafts, it can be pointed that several sectors are clearly distinguishable:&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#footnote_22_918&quot; id=&quot;identifier_22_918&quot; class=&quot;footnote-link footnote-identifier-link&quot;&gt;23&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; textiles (1, 495), foods (799), metalwork (331), “chemistry” (349),&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#footnote_23_918&quot; id=&quot;identifier_23_918&quot; class=&quot;footnote-link footnote-identifier-link&quot;&gt;24&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; clothes (306), finances (278), paper/books (253), brokerage (231), jewelry (218), and sundry services (170).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All sectors peak sometime between 300/913 CE and 500/1107 CE, but after that they show steady decline—even in those rare cases when absolute numbers remain quite significant, their percentages unmistakably go down. Practically all individual &lt;i&gt;nisbaŧ&lt;/i&gt;s show the same trend. Merchants (sing. &lt;i&gt;tājir&lt;/i&gt;, 294; Figure &lt;b&gt;18&lt;/b&gt;) constitute the only group that shows a different trend and their numbers actually grow by the end of the period. This is, however, only because this is a blanket category that encompasses all the above listed “industries, ” without emphasizing any specific one in particular. Figure &lt;b&gt;19&lt;/b&gt; shows the cumulative trend of involvement of religious scholars in crafts and trades. The curve based on absolute numbers (&lt;i&gt;left&lt;/i&gt;) shows that numbers of scholars—who were either directly involved in specific crafts and trades or came from families that made their fortune in those areas—remained rather high until 600/1204 CE; relative numbers (&lt;i&gt;right&lt;/i&gt;) show that the steady downward trend in this sector begins as early as 440/1049 CE—about three decades before the cumulative biographical curve (470/1078 CE) starts recovering.&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;b&gt;Figure 19.&lt;/b&gt; The Growth and Decline of Crafts and Trades.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By the end of the period the emphasis in identities shifts, and while “secular occupations” are still not uncommon among the learned,&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#footnote_24_918&quot; id=&quot;identifier_24_918&quot; class=&quot;footnote-link footnote-identifier-link&quot;&gt;25&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; they are definitely no longer the main focus of biographers, who instead pay more attention to positions and family connections (see section on &lt;b&gt;Professionalization&lt;/b&gt; below).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The geographical distribution of these professions is most puzzling. Essentially, all “industries” display the same pattern: the larger the region, the larger the presence of individuals involved in specific “industries.” Iraq always comes first, followed by Iran (representation by sectors varies slightly, but northeastern Iran usually has highest numbers), then Syria and Egypt. Such a geographical distribution of “industries” suggests that occupational &lt;i&gt;nisbaŧ&lt;/i&gt;s were used as necessary specifiers to distinguish among individuals in large communities.&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#footnote_25_918&quot; id=&quot;identifier_25_918&quot; class=&quot;footnote-link footnote-identifier-link&quot;&gt;26&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; This issue might be resolved by adding local biographical collections to the corpus and experimenting with data grouping until some distinctive patterns can be discerned. Data from non-literary sources will be crucial for advancing this inquiry, which requires undivided attention.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whether this decline of the civilian sector is a result of the actual withdrawal of the learned from trades and crafts, or, the loss of awareness of this part of their identity, the general effect on the development of the religious sector would still be the same: the loss of connections with broader population. It is not that religious scholars stopped maintaining connections with populace at large, but they gradually turned into a self-reproducing class whose members were primarily concerned about their own group interests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Professionalization &lt;em&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/em&gt; institutionalization&lt;/strong&gt; of the learned class are another two processes that take place during the period covered in &lt;em&gt;Taʾrīḫ al-islām&lt;/em&gt;. These processes have been discussed at length in academic literature,&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#footnote_26_918&quot; id=&quot;identifier_26_918&quot; class=&quot;footnote-link footnote-identifier-link&quot;&gt;27&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; although in most cases the emphasis is on institutionalization.&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#footnote_27_918&quot; id=&quot;identifier_27_918&quot; class=&quot;footnote-link footnote-identifier-link&quot;&gt;28&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here “professionalization” is understood as the growth of complexity of religious learning that leads to its branching into specific disciplines, mastering which eventually requires full-time commitment. Professionalization implies the development of a community of specialists who maintain qualifying standards and ensure demarcation from the non-qualified; ideally, mechanisms of monetary and status compensation for professional services should develop during this process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we agree on recognizing the process of branching of the religious learning into specific disciplines as an indicator of professionalization, we may look at the growth of religious specializations as indicated through “descriptive names.” Figure &lt;b&gt;20&lt;/b&gt; shows that the process of branching reaches its highest point during 300–350 AH/913–962 CE, after which the number of specializations remains on the same level and fluctuates only slightly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although completely devoid of both buzzwords, Melchert’s study is perhaps the most valuable insight into the process of professionalization.&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#footnote_28_918&quot; id=&quot;identifier_28_918&quot; class=&quot;footnote-link footnote-identifier-link&quot;&gt;29&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; In his book on the formation of the Sunnī legal schools (&lt;i&gt;maḏhab&lt;/i&gt;), Melchert offered three major criteria: the recognition of the chief scholar (&lt;i&gt;raʾīs&lt;/i&gt;), commentaries (&lt;i&gt;taʿliqaŧ&lt;/i&gt;) on the summaries of legal teachings (&lt;i&gt;muḫtaṣar&lt;/i&gt;), as a proof of one’s qualification, and a more or less regulated process of transmission of legal knowledge, through which the achievement of required qualification is ensured. Chronologically, Melchert placed this process for the Shāfiʿīs, Ḥanbalīs and Ḥanafīs in Baġdād of the late 9&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;—early 10&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; centuries.&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#footnote_29_918&quot; id=&quot;identifier_29_918&quot; class=&quot;footnote-link footnote-identifier-link&quot;&gt;30&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Keeping in mind this coincidence of Melchert’s close reading of legal &lt;i&gt;ṭabaqāt&lt;/i&gt; and my distant reading of &lt;em&gt;Taʾrīḫ al-islām&lt;/em&gt;, we may—at least tentatively—consider 300/913 CE to be a turning point in the process of professionalization.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;fit&quot;&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Data from the &lt;em&gt;Taʾrīḫ al-islām&lt;/em&gt; shows that professionalization of religious knowledge (around 300/913 CE) is not directly related to scholars’ abandoning their gainful occupations in the civilian sectors, as this process will start only around 430/1039 CE. However, professionalization failed to bring about one very important thing, namely more paid positions for the learned. This must have forced men of learning into difficult position where they had to maintain a delicate, but uncomfortable balance between keeping up with higher standards of religious learning and earning living. The financial difficulties that professionalization imposed on the life of a scholar may have become quite a discouraging factor for the young who were considering career paths. Keeping in mind that the decline of the main curve begins &lt;em&gt;c.&lt;/em&gt; 270/884 CE—i.e. roughly around the time when the number of religious specializations reaches its highest point—it is tempting to consider that professionalization has something to do with this decline. After all, a full-time commitment to study religious sciences leaves one no time to earn a living through gainful occupations in the civilian sector. Charging money for teaching religious subjects was considered illicit, and there are hardly any indications that the number of positions for religious specialists grew to compensate for this unfortunate development. To succeed in such conditions, one had to be either extremely resolute or come from a wealthy family to afford the career of a scholar. And since both of these are in limited availability in any society, this could explain the decline in numbers of biographies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The introduction and spread of &lt;i&gt;waqf&lt;/i&gt; institutions is considered a turning point in the institutionalization of the learned. The salaried positions of these institutions offered a solution to the complication of professionalization. Frequencies of references to &lt;i&gt;waqf&lt;/i&gt; institutions in biographies (Figure &lt;b&gt;21&lt;/b&gt;) show that they—most importantly the &lt;i&gt;madrasaŧ&lt;/i&gt;s—become a noteworthy detail of biographies soon after 400/1010 CE, about 100 lunar years after the turning point in professionalization, and a very important one after 500/1107 CE.&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#footnote_30_918&quot; id=&quot;identifier_30_918&quot; class=&quot;footnote-link footnote-identifier-link&quot;&gt;31&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, by offering salaried positions, the &lt;i&gt;waqf&lt;/i&gt; institutions also reconfigured the structure of the learned class, which in the long run had a very negative effect. In his study of medieval Damascus,&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#footnote_31_918&quot; id=&quot;identifier_31_918&quot; class=&quot;footnote-link footnote-identifier-link&quot;&gt;32&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Chamberlain convincingly argued that salaried positions (&lt;i&gt;manāṣib&lt;/i&gt;) became one of the major object of contention among the learned who were now concerned about winning and holding as many of these positions as it was possible. One of their strategies was to ensure that the positions stayed within a family—household—which led to the formation of the dynasties of religious scholars and, in the long run, the transformation of the religious class into a rather closed social stratum, to which the word “clergy” became more and more applicable as time went on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;half&quot;&gt;

	&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;b&gt;Figure 22.&lt;/b&gt; References to Relatives. The graph on the left shows the major categories of relatives, while the on on the right shows the same data combined into one graph.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the data from the &lt;em&gt;Taʾrīḫ al-islām&lt;/em&gt; indicate (Figure &lt;b&gt;22&lt;/b&gt;), the role of family connections unmistakably increases after 400/1010 CE. The tribal nature of early Islamic society explains the high frequency of references to close relatives in the early periods. However, references to parents are most frequent—largely to fathers&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#footnote_32_918&quot; id=&quot;identifier_32_918&quot; class=&quot;footnote-link footnote-identifier-link&quot;&gt;33&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;—which is understandable, considering the importance of lineage through the male line within tribal society. But again, the curve of references goes down steadily between 120/739 CE and 380/991 CE, mirroring the curve of tribal identities that also goes down while the number of biographies keeps on growing. After 380/991 CE references to family members practically skyrocket, and even increase in pace slightly around 500/1107 CE. Unlike in the early period, references to most members of the immediate family become very common: parents (the word “parent, ” &lt;em&gt;wālid[aŧ]&lt;/em&gt;, become particularly common), siblings (brothers and sisters—&lt;i&gt;aḫū&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;uḫt&lt;/i&gt;), children (sons and daughters—&lt;em&gt;ibnu-hu&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;bintu-hu&lt;/em&gt;, etc.), and, to a lesser extent, spouses (husbands and wives—&lt;em&gt;zawj[aŧ]&lt;/em&gt;). The same trend can be seen in the references to uncles, aunts, grandparents and grandchildren. These shifts—not just the growth of frequencies, but also the growth of varieties of familial references—may be interpreted as a shift of scholarly attention from the lineage to the household.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we accept these rates of frequencies as an indicator of the formation of households, than it appears that scholarly households begin growing earlier than &lt;i&gt;waqf&lt;/i&gt; institutions. The growth of scholarly families thus may have been caused by professionalization and then boosted by institutionalization.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;concluding-remark&quot;&gt;Concluding Remark&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The presented model is exploratory. It is rather simple, but it is transparent. Explicitly described models can be discussed, compared, modified, and applied to new sources. With models we can stop futile discussions about the meaning and reliability of certain data and start exploring Islamic history experimentally. By developing and testing multiple complex models we can eventually arrive to a better understanding of both our sources and processes that they describe. With models we can compare multiple sources, even evaluate entire genres. Right now, when scholars of Islam are entering the domain of digital humanities, there is a dire need for transparency of our methods—and modeling appears to be the most optimal option—especially if we venture to study the entire digital corpus of classical Arabic sources, which at the moment may have already exceeded 800 million words.&lt;/p&gt;

    While most humanists remain skeptical in regard to working with big data, the number of studies that show that close reading alone is not enough keeps on growing. They emphasize that case studies based on close reading do not allow for extrapolations; that humanists are prone to putting too much effort into studying objects that are unique and for this reason are least likely to represent larger trends. Most vivid examples can be found in the field of literary history, see, e.g., &lt;b&gt;&lt;b&gt;Moretti (2007)&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;Moretti (2013)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;&lt;b&gt;Jockers (2013)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;.

    Bulliet’s model of conversion is a great example of this. The very fact that this study is still criticized after more than three decades from its publication shows that a solid model cannot be discarded through a critique of where it fails, if otherwise it still remains plausible and coherent. For the most recent critique, see: &lt;b&gt;&lt;b&gt;Wasserstein (2013)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;.

    Unfortunately, at the moment my algorithms are not tuned well enough to trace all individuals who belonged to the military sector. The &lt;i&gt;nisbaŧ&lt;/i&gt; &lt;i&gt;al-amīr&lt;/i&gt; should serve well as an indicator: it is the most frequent “descriptive name” within the military sector and it is the easiest to trace computationally.

    Somehow, the “Fulān al-dīn” names still have a strong steel aftertaste. The most common first components of the “Fulān al-dawlaŧ” pattern are Sayf al-dawlaŧ, “Sword of the Dynasty;” Nāṣir..., “Helper...;” Naṣr, “Victory;” Muʿizz, “Strengthener;” ʿIzz, “Strength;” ʿAḍud, “Support;” Tāj, “Crown;” Bahāʾ, “Splendor;” Ḥusām, “Cutting Edge.” The most first components of the “Fulān al-dīn” pattern are: Sayf al-dīn, “Sword of Religion;” ʿIzz..., “Strength...;” Jamāl, “Beauty;” Badr, “Full Moon;” Shams, “Sun;” Ṣalāḥ, “Goodness;” Ḥusām, “Cutting Edge;” Quṭb, “Pole;” ʿAlam, “Banner.” [&lt;a href=&quot;#identifier_19_918&quot; class=&quot;footnote-link footnote-back-link&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;]

    There is also a late peak that corresponds to the restoration of the independence of the ʿAbbāsid caliphate during the second half of the 6th/12th century, but it is short-lived.

    Very similar to what Bulliet argued regarding toponymic &lt;i&gt;nisbaŧ&lt;/i&gt;s: “For example Karkh, a popular quarter of Baghdad, appears in the nisba al-Karkhī when representation from Iraq is high. When the proportion is smaller, the name of the major city itself is a common nisba. In the example given, a later resident of Karkh would appear as al-Baghdadī. Finally, when the proportion is very low, the nisba will frequently be derived from the entire province, that is, al-Baghdadī becomes al-ʿIrāqī.” (&lt;b&gt;&lt;b&gt;Bulliet (1979)&lt;/b&gt;, p. 12&lt;/b&gt;).

To a large extent Berkey’s and Chamberlain’s studies are responses to Makdisi’s “over-institutionalization.” [&lt;a href=&quot;#identifier_26_918&quot; class=&quot;footnote-link footnote-back-link&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;]

    It seems that Gilbert is the only one to use this term in her study of the learned of Medieval Damascus: see, &lt;b&gt;&lt;b&gt;Gilbert (1980)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;. However, in her study this term appears to blend into institutionalization and both become practically indistinguishable. Other scholars mention professionalization almost exclusively with the reference to Gilbert’s work. See, for example: &lt;b&gt;&lt;b&gt;Chamberlain (1994)&lt;/b&gt;, p. 70&lt;/b&gt;; &lt;b&gt;&lt;b&gt;Ephrat (2000)&lt;/b&gt;, p. 104, 179&lt;/b&gt;.

    The failure of the Mālikīs Melchert explains by their being too closely linked to the caliphal patronage and when the caliphs were eclipsed, so were the Mālikīs.

    The decline of the frequency of the word &lt;i&gt;madrasa&lt;/i&gt; should not be interpreted as a decline of this institution, but rather as a change in the form of reference in general: most &lt;i&gt;madrasaŧ&lt;/i&gt;s are referred to by their “al-Fulānīyaŧ” names (see Figure &lt;b&gt;14&lt;/b&gt;).

    The most common references are the forms of &lt;i&gt;abū&lt;/i&gt;, “father.” Since this word is also the essential part of &lt;i&gt;kunyaŧ&lt;/i&gt;, an extremely common patronymic element of the Arab/Muslim name, only its forms with pronominal suffixes—such as &lt;i&gt;abū-hu&lt;/i&gt;, “his father”—are considered. The same principle is applied to other ambiguous family terms. [&lt;a href=&quot;#identifier_32_918&quot; class=&quot;footnote-link footnote-back-link&quot;&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;]

Humanists now have access to huge corpora that open research possibilities that were unthinkable a decade or two ago. However, working with corpora requires a rather different approach that is more characteristic of sciences than humanities. Namely, one has to be transparent and explicit with regard to how data are extracted and how they are analyzed. Text-mining techniques rely on explicit algorithms because they help tracing mistakes, correcting them and, ultimately, improving results.</summary></entry></feed>
